I thought I’ll immediately get a lot of followers because i have pretty privilege. Surprise surprise I didn’t. And now I wanna ask y’all- what shall i do to be a non cringy Instagram influencer. I have a bunch of undeveloped talents because “sorry ma’am mumma allow nhi kr rhi”.

My childhood was marked by limited resources—second-hand books, clothes, and cycles—and changing three schools due to my father’s business losses.\n\nAfter school, I started earning through tuitions. I was a mediocre student until graduation, where I fell in love for the first time. She inspired confidence in me, but the relationship ended after graduation due to inter-religious differences. Around this time, my father suffered a stroke. With no family support, I traveled alone to another state, found him in the ICU, and took sole responsibility for his care until he recovered.\n\nTo support my family, I joined a cement company in Meghalaya as an Accounts Executive but saw no professional growth. Returning home, I pursued an MBA from a tier-3 college, worked hard, and secured the highest placement of ₹5 LPA in 2018. Opting for Mumbai, I faced financial struggles but gained valuable exposure.\n\nI later took a break to prepare for JRF, missing it by 1.5 marks. During COVID, I worked tirelessly, traveling for work while supporting my family. I gave my father early retirement, financed my sister’s education, and shifted my entire family to NCR, enrolling my sister in Delhi University.\n\nI married without taking any dowry, financing the wedding myself. Over the past two years, I’ve supported my wife in building her teaching career, though we’ve postponed our honeymoon due to financial priorities.\n\n*Conclusion - In my 6.5 years of carrier I grew in the sense of designation but my pay package is still low in comparison to my requirements and survival of my family in NCR.*\n\n*Currently I am unemployed, lost my job because of office politics. My savings is almost finished, I gave myself the time till December'24 ending.*\n\n*I want to start a YT channel on a very unique niche, but I need money to survive. At this point of my career I cannot follow my passion blindly and survive my family as well.*\n\n*I am very lost, I have seen difficulties and struggles but this time it's coming from all the directions. If I would not able to find a WFH job to survive my family and follow my passion of doing YT till ending Dec.'24 may be...*\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "post": "Hey all,\n\nAnother winter weekend and I joined a heritage walk to the Humayun's Tomb complex.\n\nLearnt a few surprising facts:\n\n1. This was actually the 3rd place Humayun was buried in, that too 16 years after his death. He was first buried in Purana Qila, then in Sirhind (Punjab). The Tomb took 8 years to build and later inspired the Taj Mahal (you can notice the similarities like the onion dome and the four-part garden).\n\n2. It is often romanticized that Humayun's widow Bega Begum commissioned this tomb for the \"love of her life\". But it was actually Akbar who commissioned and supervised it, Bega Begum was mostly undertaking Hajj.\n\n3. The tomb pavilion is littered with graves - more than 150 graves of them, making it a \"Mughal necropolis\". Proximity to the Nizamuddin Dargah made this a sacred burial place.\n\n4. This place marks both the rise and fall of the Mughals. The last emperor, Bahadur Shah Zahar, was arrested at this very spot during the revolt of 1857.\n\n5. It became a refuge for those displaced by the 1947 Partition. ASI has since reacquired and conserved it, then restored with the help of Aga Khan Trust for Culture. There's crazy restoration work still going on around the Site museum and Sundar Nursery.\n\nHistorical facts aside, I was guided to some cool architectural details throughout the complex. Happy to share in the next post.\n\nP.S. Delhiites and travellers, please go for heritage walks when you can. It feels like reeducation. And Delhi has the most intense history of all. ",

Initially, I was leaning towards a trek, but I’m still exploring other options. I’m open to traveling solo, though joining a group could work too.\n \nIf you have any recommendations for destinations or experiences that are great during this time of year, I’d love to hear them! Trekking options are still on the table, but I’m also interested in anything unique, adventurous, or a bit offbeat; a location will be great.\n \nThanks in advance for your suggestions!\n",

It's an NGO for sheltered and slum children. We provide them with education.\n\n*Why is it harder to teach sheltered children?*\n\nThere was a girl , whose parents threw her out of their house because they were struggling financially. She was rescued by a shelter. Hurt and scared , she did not feel comfortable and felt suffocated at the shelter. There was one of our  teacher, she felt emotionally connected with. So one day, she decided to follow her home. \n\n\nIn the similar way , a lot children do not feel comfortable and trust anyone. They have been trafficked , raped and abandoned. \n\nSo the first step is to foster trust in them. As it's difficult to teach a child who is always on fight and flight mode. \n\nThe second step is to teach them life values and skills. These children did not see a good world around nor did their parents. It's hard to teach children ' honesty is the best policy ' , when their own parents cheat on them or ' respect women ' when their dads come home drunk and best their wives. \n\n*Why is this education important?* \n\nWe have noticed that if we do not help them get better, they often turn to the criminal ways. And they don't even realise that what they are doing is wrong. I would like to take an example of the Menendez brothers. There were two Little boys who were sexually abused by their father their whole childhood. During their trial , the elder brother confessed that whenever he felt a sexual urge , he would take his younger brother to the woods and perform the same. It wasn't because he was evil , it's just that he was a child. In the same way , our children cannot comprehend the consequences of their actions either. They don't know what they are doing is wrong as that's all they have learned growing up. \n\n*Why do we need funds ?* \n\nMost of the funds are required for the teachers. They have to be specially trained and need a regular income. \n\n*How much do we need?* \n\nThere is no limit , even on the minimum donation. But to put things in perspective, ₹36,000 will help us find the education of 2 children for an entire year. \n\n\nI hope this reaches your heart as it did for us. \nThank you Delhi for your kindness:) \n\nDonation link :- https://muskurahat.org.in/donate?r=char3458",

I'm not an introvert but im not a very social person either, a teetotaler and a non smoker as well. I'm doing decent in life was good academically and value intellectual connect over anything else. It's just that I don't mix up well with people and don't talk casually, due to this I have became very silent and stay at my home mostly nowadays even on weekends when I'm free. So in all i have became a shyest version of myself.\n\nI just cannot bug anyone as I find it creepy to talk to any random person or pursue them even for friendship so it's quite daunting for me. Deep down I'm a very caring person and literally at times want to feel affection but yeah that's not possible for now it seems. I don't think I'm cool enough for dating apps, plus I don't prefer hookups or casual stuff as well. I just want a single relationship whom I can be devoted to that's it.\n\nSo, please provide genuine suggestions on where to find people to date who have similar mindset and kind of looking for same, dating apps and gym are a no for me.

I'll put question marks if I'm not sure of some details.\n\n\\- An intern guy around 22 (?) was living in his friend's house (?) and his friend is away so he is alone. And he works from home. \n\n\\- There's an old lady living her family across his flat and he sees every now and then in the balcony from his balcony. \n\n\\- The flat above that is always almost dark but there is somebody living in it that he doesn't know. \n\n\\- One day he needed cardboards for some work so he asks the old lady, then he meets the girl living above the old lady's flat. \n\n\\- She offers him cardboards, he accepts them. This is when shit began to go down.\n\n\\- After a day or two, he invites her over, grooms himself, made her rajma chawal (?) to watch a movie. She get disinterested, starts using her phone but somehow this leads to her stripping herself. This didn't go forward but it did after a couple of days later (?) I guess, bro 'thunk with his d'.\n\n\\- He also suspects that her bad mental health is because of her skin care meds, which she refuses to stop. \n\n\\- She is preparing for some entrance exam away from her family, her father/brother (?) also visited during this time. Her family is very rich too.\n\n\\- By the end bro got scared (?) because she took picks of him naked and asked her to leave, later she attempted suicide, her family took her to hospital. He stopped updating because his lawyer suggested to.\n\nI remember way too much about this post. Does anyone, local in Delhi know what happened. Was it covered in news? Did he post any update later in the sub with another account? Is bro even alive??",

Also this is the second time it's happening. So i pushed them for a replacement but they didn't agree. Lastly they said they'll refund the entire amount without any return. At first I was like wow. But, now I feel guilty. So I contacted them again to replace it and not return it. But they are not agreeing. They say they cannot replace it but refund the entire amount without refund ?

He sat on the seat just by the senior citizens' one. Some lady entered with her family(4 females) from an interchanging statio. Meanwhile, I, who was sitting opposite, gave his seat to another lady. Anyway, that woman sat on her seat, asked one of her bahus to sit alongside, asked the third one to sit in between, which made the foreigner already uncomfortable. She started looking around and then asked the foreigner to stand up as the fourth lady needed to sit somehow. I stood there watching all of this and was like, \"sorry for this ordeal bro\". He stood up and in the meantime another man who was sitting beside the foreigner, voluntarily gave his seat to another woman who just happened to stand by those ladies. I think that this sacrifice of seats by men is taken as an act of strength display. And women are just the facilitators in this. Why are we getting so cold and unwelcoming towards foreigners? And why is giving up on one's seat becoming a norm?",

I don't know how to enjoy being alone. I currently live in a PG, sharing a room. The rent is 12,000 and the room still sucks. it has no window, which makes me feel so trapped and lonely in night. \n\nI want to meet new people, but I'm scared because I'm a girl and it's Delhi. I don't have a female best friend, and my roommate is mad (she is taking medicines)\n\nI want to make female friends, but I can't find any. I know it's not hard to make friends, but I only seem to attract people who are not nice. I'm not rich, and I don't have the mental capacity to apply for jobs.\n\nI don't even know what I should do. I want to leave Delhi, but my mom makes my life miserable back home. Can anyone please guide me or help me?\n\nI also want to find a new place to live for under 10,000 rupees. I know it's not easy, but I'll try. I'm afraid of living with new people because of the horror stories I've heard.\n\nI just wants it to get better. Please only dm me if you have suggestions regarding my situation/place recommendation/club's suggestion/friend's community",

One couple in our group bought masala chai, cinnamon bark, green cardamom, and mango tea and charged ~3000₹ for this (likely not a fair price, but they had been burnt out on haggling and gave in for this).\n\nMy partner and I bought these items also and along with 3 others: blue tea, masala spice, and turmeric matcha. We were charged 12399₹. \n\nSeems obvious we were overcharged as uninformed first timers but live and learn I guess.

I know the indian IT revolution is due to south india.

I turned to my friend and said, “Bhai, chalo 6km try karte hain. 4-5 km ke baad shayad gir jaayenge, par target 6 rakhte hain.”\n\nWe started running and, somehow, managed to finish the 6km in 46-47 minutes.\n\nAfter that, I kept showing up every Sunday, and honestly, I don’t know when or how running became such a big part of my life. Fast forward three months: I ran a half marathon with the same group. Oh, and the day before that half marathon, I ran 9km as well.\n\nFrom barely finishing 6km at a pace of 7:46/km to running 22km at 6:03/km, and now training for 5-6km at a pace of 4:23/km—it’s been a wild ride.\n\nI’ve done so much in just three months, and I never thought I’d be able to run like this, let alone enjoy it.

Asked her to transfer him 5000 on UPI and held the knife touching her wrist. She froze. Paid him. Left and came to my place. \n\nLater when we got all it checked, the guy had 40 complaints about him already pending about the same offence. Each time the price varied along the metro station but it always gets transferred to his UPI. \n\nTime was around 5 in the evening.

        "post": "Please help.\n\nSo one of the person I know has gone missing around 2 weeks back in sector 41, 39 (City Center Metro, exit gate 4 side.. ) . This is person is a young woman , around \\~24 years old, her family runs one of those Coal Ironing services/shops (that you see in nearly every Noida society), in **Sector 41, B block.** And she went missing onwards **Nov,24th.**\n\nThey have filed a case in the nearest thana, (sector 39), but the police has been of little help. They havent been able to do anything beyond investigating the Cams installed in the society houses. Specially given the family dont have the privileged background and are not locals, the pace of further investigation is bit slow. Society representatives and houses nearby those who knew them , opted for their services are trying to help  as much as they can, but not a lot has been traced so far. \n\nSince, the society is heavily secured (guards in front of nearly house), and since it was Sunday, it was virtually impossible for it to be an Abduction case, as last time she was spotted around 1 PM during the day, the shop's peak hour on Sunday. She was the only one doing the work most of the time, her mum and fathers used to often come by during evening hours/closing of the shop.\n\nSo it looked like a case of Elopement , and that's what some of the installed active Cams in the society corroborated as well, She was seen walking out of the Sector 41 gate 2 willingly during mid-day, and spotted by some of the Cams around City center metro as well. \n\nHer family is fearing the worst, I know her parents and they look like simple nice folks trying to make a living. her mum is saying they never ever oppressed their children and trying to provide them whatever amenities possible to her children. Never ever tried to put any restrictions on them. And that's what it appeared to me as well whenever I interacted with them, and the missing person. Although, her family did mention, she was pretty gullible.\n\nNot sure what I could do to help them, I went back to their shop today, the checked on them. But the mum started crying, it was heart wrenching to watch and i could do  nothing but try to  console her. \n\n  \nLet me know guys if u can help in any way. \n\n**So some of the key details that her family has:**\n\nName: **Rinki** \n\nAge : **24 years old**\n\nDate of missing: **November, 24th, Sunday**\n\nPlace of missing: **Sector 41, 39  , City Center Metro**\n\nThe day she went missing, she was **wearing Pink suit.**\n\nthe phone number she was carrying was: **8920166050**\n\nafter some deep digging her relatives done to get her call details record,  **last time she was talking to this phone number: 9220436201**\n\nboth of these numbers are coming switched off right now.. \n\nI feel like if police wanted , they could trace her back quite easily. But looks like they are not helping much, since the family doesn;t have any backing and they aren't locals.\n\n[\\(pic of the missing person, not of the day she went missing\\)](https://preview.redd.it/074tugx7eo5e1.jpg?width=488&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2a1f94ade1dd97774b63c0c076b435a7f888f3c)\n\n",

But to my surprise, there were so many people in proper cosplays, and not just bootleg versions of characters - but damn awesome cosplays which these people would have worked hard on, I'm sure. If you're one of the cosplayers reading this, i have made respect for each and every one of you, the cosplays were seriously awesome today, and I'm sure they would have been just as amazing on other days as well.\n\nAs for me, I wasn't planning to do any heavy cosplay myself but I did decide to carry one of my Pokemon plush on my shoulder to be sort of a 'pokemon trainer' (it was my sleeping bulbasaur, and my wife carried a Charmander in her arms - alebit on my demand, as she felt shy at first), which gained quite the popularity. Some even came and asked where we bought them from and people were specially commenting on how nice both the Pokemon looked, some people just visibly passing a smile and verbally pointing towards me and saying \"BULBASAUR\", or commenting on both our Pokemons, which was fun. For anyone wondering how it looked, [here's a preview](https://i.postimg.cc/ZqdgnJXQ/RDT-20241209-0005088821313464936458582.png).\n\nOverall, it was quite a fun experience, and I'm hoping others had a fun time as well.

        "post": "This just happened today. I was going to a reception, and was crossing the connecting under-bridge between one side to other side of the Shyam Park metro station. It is like a 50 meter walk, as the gates are not exactly on the opposite side of the road.\n\nThere were three people on bridge. A tall for his age guy, he was 5'10, but was like 18-19 years old. A small girl, not more than 10 years of age, and another kid with yellow porcupine like hair, busy on his phone.\n\nThe guy was holding the girl's arm by her elbow and some commotion was going on. Kid with phone was obviously with the guy, just standing there. Girl was in distress, and some argument was going on. As I approached, the girl threw her slippers from the bridge down to the road. I went past them, and after few steps, I thought I should intervene. \n\nSo I turned back, and got to them, and said \"हाँ भाई क्या चल रहा है\"\nThey just stated at me like what?\nThis time, I kind of shouted \"क्या चल kya रहा है\"\nThe guy let go of her arm.\nThen I looked at girl and said \"यह लोग परेशान कर रहे हैं क्या?\"\nGirl just said नहीं. \n\nObviously these idiots knew each other.\nI said \"अभी Security को बताता हूं जाकर\"\nAnd started walking away towards the side I had to go to. I looked back and saw the guys quickly walking to the other side and the girl coming along my side. I promptly told the security and they said they will take care of them, I think they must have radioed the other side, as I saw them talking on radio when I was taking stairs.\n\nI am not an intimidating person, I am just a lady. It took courage to stand up to the guy and question him. I was visibly nervous too, but I knew something was wrong and I decided to do something about it. ",

        "post": "I’m 26 years old and I have very poor social skills. I used to be an extroverted and outgoing person as a child, but my parents started controlling my life, and I ended up spending many years in social isolation. This has made it really hard for me to connect with others and talk to people.\n\nNow, because of my poor social skills, I find it difficult to work and interact with others. My mind often goes blank when someone talks to me, and it takes me so much time to process what other person is saying. I feel slow and don’t know what to say, so most of the time I stay quiet. I worry that I’ll say something stupid or dumb. I feel like I’m a burden to others because of my disability and lack of social skills, which makes me afraid of talking to people. I don’t start conversations because I’m scared of coming across as annoying, and I wait for others to talk to me instead.\n\nI am not useful to others, I don’t have interesting life experiences to share. I don’t know how to keep a conversation going. My friends are extroverts, but I don’t really enjoy talking to them or anyone else. I don’t know when to start or stop talking, and I feel like I’m just a burden. I struggle to understand how others manage to connect with each other so naturally. I constantly force myself to socialize, but I don’t enjoy it. \n\nHow do you socialize with people and friends in your day-to-day life? Why do you enjoy socializing? How can I improve my social skills, and how can I stop feeling like a burden in social situations? What steps can I take to become more comfortable with socializing and connect with others in a meaningful way?\n\nI really want to improve and stop feeling isolated, but I’m not sure how to take the first step. Any advice, tips, or personal experiences would be really helpful.",

        "post": "i had my volleyball tournament last night which ended at 9 pm (letting this information be known so that noone comes at me asking what were you even doing out on the road at 10 pm).\n\ni took metro, safely travelled and reached my station at 10 pm. from there, i decided to book an uber (i live around 20-25 minutes away from metro station).\n\nit wont be an exaggeration to say that i was beyond anxious after leaving metro because it was my first time being out on the road this late at night and that also all by myself as a teenager. \n\noutside metro station, i couldnt see a single lady. men everywhere.\n\nanyways, i decided to book a car because i thought a car driver would be more trustable than an auto rickshaw driver + auto mein thand lagti hai.\n\nso there's a small park type thing with trees nearby the main road, i stood outside that place facing the main road waiting for my uber. \n\ni turned back and i spotted a man inside that park type area facing me creepily. i have no idea how he got there. i squinted my eyes and saw him vigorously moving his hands up and down below his stomach. my brain was fogged and processing information very slowly. \n\nbut i was definitely creeped out by the sight and my first thought was that its a ghost because i grew up listening to my grandmother's ghost stories.\n\nthen after a few minutes, it hit me what he was doing with his hands and i sprinted away from him. \n\ni was disgusted and scared beyond imagination. i felt like every man in the vehicle passing by was eyeing me as i waited for my uber. and the way i was getting eyed, it was definitely not out of concern. \n\ni found out from one acquaintance that the creepy man has been spotted there a few times this month (and that place has two schools nearby, every afternoon kids pass by that area) and you know what agitated me to the point of tears? the speculation that he is a school bus driver. \n\nanyways, uber showed up. the guy minded his own business, i minded mine and i felt so grateful for getting bare minimum: basic human decency. i made it home safely. \n\ntoday i told the entire incident to one of my friends and she scolded me for taking an uber car alone at my night, she once did the same and the guy had a kept a GUN A REAL GUN with him aage. although the driver didnt do anything to her but still...? why was an uber driver casually carrying a gun with him? but then again, anything is possible in delhi.\n\nanyways, she reasoned that auto is safer because its open.\n\nbut the point is that, cant such men (like that creepy jerking guy) be reported and taken away? little kids pass by that area and he is out there performing such acts.\n\nwill i be listened to if i go to police station alone to get a complaint written against that man? i am not aware about the procedure.\n\ni just want to do my part and take some action against that man. 🙏 what can i do?\n\nEDIT: a lot of people here told me to just not travel alone at night. but what could i have done here in this situation? i wasn't aware ki tournament itna extend ho jayega (i was there from 11 am) and my coach was reluctant to let me leave in between the tournament, they bluntly said no as it was an important tournament.\n\nthe only option i had was to travel back alone since i had noone who could pick me up. my mother was out of town and i had my 12 year old sibling at home. noone else.\n\ni just want to say that, sometimes it's unavoidable to not travel at night alone as a girl. what do we do then?",

        "post": "Sorry for the long read but if anyone has experienced the same please lemme know what I should do. I bought some items from MyProtein India on their Black Friday sale and prepaid for the stuff. It’s been weeks now and it still hasn’t arrived. They use Delhivery to deliver, and I’ve been tracking my order for all this time. They keep updating that order will arrive today and then update later with “ refused by customer”. They never contacted me nor came to the address! \n\nSo yesterday I raised the issue and even got call from customer support and he assured it will delivered in 24 hours. Today it showed it will be delivered today and the same thing happens, “ refused by customer”. I tried calling the delivery guy on number given but it says “number is busy” and hangs up. \n\nI looked them up in X and saw so many other similar complaints with same response from their team that they will look into it and ensure delivery. Now I am worried the delivery executive might have stolen my items at this point or something. If they return it and cancel my order, I lose the offer since Black Friday is over and I might not get refund either. Since I saw many people had same issue on X, I wondered if anyone got any advice on it. Should I try to get the parcel myself from their centre? The customer service is basically useless where I just get to message a bot and just wait until they reach back to me! Is Delhivery a bad courier service or what?",

However, after paying PG rent and clearing small debts (which I still have). I was left with nothing for the rest of the month, so I could barely save anything.\n\nI haven't paid my PG rent for almost two months now.\n\nMy parents passed away a while ago, and since then, I've been on my own. After their demise, I had to go through a lot alone. I was in 12th standard back then, and no one came forward to support me. Instead, my relatives cheated me on money. Seeing me in crisis, even my friends left me.\n\nSomehow, I passed 12th through NIOS and started earning, it took me a while to start earning because losing my parents and witnessing the behavior of people i once called my loved one left me with anxiety and severe depression.\n\nI even tried to end my life twice. But gradually. with the help of a kind stranger, I started getting better. It was a long journey, but I no longer have thoughts of ending my life and genuinely want to live now.\n\nI worked on upskilling myself and learned digital marketing. Thanks to that, I secured an entry-level position in digital marketing and worked there for almost a year.\n\nUnfortunately, I lost that job in August and have been struggling to find a new one ever since. I'm willing to do anything. I've even tried applying for call center and mall jobs but haven't had any luck so far.\n\nThe only jobs I'm being offered are as a sales executive or a helper, but they're too far from where I live, I can't even afford the metro fare. I only have 5 rs in my bank account.\n\nI'm at a point where I can't afford food or my rent, and I'll probably lose the roof over my head soon and will be out on the streets.\n\nI'm trying hard not to panic, but I have no one to turn to, and I often break down in tears. This feels like dead end.\n\n\nUPI: abhikaushikak11@ibl",

Etc etc. Before our brain could even process or developed properly we get traumatised by our school Teachers. I'm talking about Kindergarten teachers as well. If someone is a 90's kid they might understand what I'm saying. How do you guys deal with those dreams lmao. It's so frustrating that you deserve to learn only abcd but you got traumas as a free package.\nAs compared to those who had normal school life who had normal teachers my school teacher was very abusive since kindergarten. \nWhen I grew up I made new friends and what I noticed is that they catch things very fast and their observation skill is also very good. My brain was always in survival mode after coming out from school. Sometimes my new friends would say ...kaha kho jaati hai bar bar. I would totally go into another reality. It was always hard to be present in a present moment. ",

        "post": "I’ve noticed this strange trend when meeting random people – they always seem to bring up politics or religion, trying to probe into my views on these topics. Honestly, I’m not interested in either, and I see these as huge red flags for casual conversations.\n\nIt’s not just that. Younger people I meet often want to discuss the type of entertainment I consume, and if it’s not “Westernized” enough for them, they immediately start judging. At the same time, they hesitate to discuss intelligent topics or anything thought-provoking. Instead, they spend hours obsessing over influencers’ lifestyles, crappy reality shows, and other superficial stuff.\n\nHere’s my take: I’m not into any of these things, and I have zero interest in talking about them. The topics I do enjoy discussing are niche, and the people who get it genuinely enjoy engaging with me on them.\n\nBut to everyone else: Stop being so judgmental. Broaden your knowledge. Show some value when you meet someone random instead of flaunting this shallow side of yourself. Talk about meaningful things. Make people want to reach out to you instead of leaving them feeling like they’ve wasted their time.\n\nWhat’s your take on this? Have you noticed the same behavior? How do you handle these situations?",

But not this time. \n\nI'm being strong and trying to detach myself from her which is quite tough cuz it still affects me but yeah that's the crux.\n\nAnd all this started in November. But acc to Spotify I've been listening to Bin Tere since January. Like wtf. Seems like God was preparing me for this situation lol.\n\nHowever, I just wanna say don't get attached to someone this smoothly. Observe them, don't be expressive when it's one sided they take you for granted. And above all, don't keep expectations. These things fucking hurt. Also, I've realised that even you're better than someone than that previous person that doesn't mean you'll stay with that person. Life is unfair yet surprising.\n\nThanks for reading. Happy Weekend :)",

        "post": "Long post but an interesting read. \n\nTL; DR in comments.\n\nI am getting married tomorrow. It's an arranged marriage. I work in England as a Cryospheric scientist. She works in India as a microbiologist. \n\nMy rishta was confirmed while I was still in UK, so my roka happened without me with my Mom putting a ring on her finger on my behalf. Of course, as in every courtship, we started texting each other everyday whenever it was possible. The time difference made it slightly difficult but we still managed. We grew our fondness for each other as the time went by. My productivity at work also increased because she never allowed me to feel alone abroad. \n\nShe is extremely shy and I love her voice, but we hardly called each other because she was always surrounded by her family members and it was always a struggle to find time and a secluded place to have a casual call. But texting to din bhar chalti rehti thi. In the meanwhile, she became best friends with my little sister and they started to hang out together and go for wedding shopping as well. My mom used to call her and her mom every few days just to check on their prep and also to calm them down. They were panicking to arrange for the \"gifts\" which we politely refused since it was essentially like a dowry in disguise and my family has always been against it. We have everything in our home and there is no space to include new stuff anyways.\n\nMy sister mentioned that my fiancé is extremely introverted, soft-spoken and shy in real life. She had told my sister that she is dreading the day she finally sees me because it will be awkward the first time 🙈. \n\nNevertheless, we finally decided to meet for the first time when I came back to India last week. Of course I was looking forward to it but she backed out last minute because she could not muster courage and got all red. I sent my sister instead and she told me that meri fiancé ko bohot zyada sharm aa rahi thi 😅 She now wants to reserve all the awkwardness for the first night and will try to manage somehow.\n\nSo now it's kind of official. I will meet her for the first time ever in my life... AS MY WIFE 💍, a very rare thing to happen in today's times. She told me to take care of her the first night because she will be shying away a lot but I am confident about myself, its going to be great. I have arranged some cute gifts and setting in the room so let's see how it goes. \n\nWish me luck Delhi 😇\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the love ♥️ Didn't knew it will blow up like this. I can see some comments of genuine concerns as well. I can actually understand and relate with them, mostly because same thoughts came to my mind as well. Turns out we both are very simple people with very simple requirements from life. Our relation never felt very complex to us, maybe because we are mature enough as I am 30, she is 28. Sab kuch soch samajh kar hi decide kiya hai. \n\nAlso, she has a job starting next April in England so we will be moving with me 😊 We planned for it well in advance.\n\nMujhe time nahi mil paa raha saare comments padhne ka aur reply dene ka because I am busy 😅 so sorry guys !\n\nEdit 2: Some of you took offence on the word \"first night\". It was not meant to be taken that way for sure. I don't what other phrase I could have used to get across my point but I just meant our first time interacting together in person. Please don't take it the other way. Not everything should be connected to those stuff, especially when the context of our union is not a usual one ! ",

        "post": "I’ve been holding onto this for so long, and I need to let it out because I’m completely lost. Here’s my story:\n\nI went through a breakup on 2nd May 2024, and it’s been eating me alive ever since. I’m not sure if it was entirely my fault, but my ex said I didn’t put in enough effort during the last 5–6 months of our relationship because I was focused on preparing for an important exam.\n\nWe met in college back in 2021. For two amazing years, it was a regular, fun relationship—we saw each other every day, went out, and really enjoyed life together. But things changed after June 2023 when I moved back to Haryana while she stayed in Delhi.\n\nOur long-distance setup wasn’t ideal, I admit. We met just once in 4 months, and while I texted her almost 24/7, I could only manage to call 2–3 times a week because of my schedule. She said I didn’t even do the bare minimum, and that hurt because I thought I was trying in the ways I could.\n\nIn May 2024, she broke up with me, saying she didn’t love me anymore. She said I wasn’t worth it and that her new boyfriend, who she started dating in July, gives her the peace I couldn’t. When I asked her how she moved on so quickly, she told me she had already lost feelings for me back in December.\n\nHearing that shattered me. For three years, I gave my heart to this relationship, and now I feel like I’m just left with regret. I’ve been begging her to come back, promising to do better, but she doesn’t care.\n\nIt’s been two months since I found out about her new boyfriend, and I haven’t been able to focus on anything—not even my studies. She even said her new guy is better than me in every way. That broke me completely.\n\n7th October 2024 – The Call\n\nThen, out of nowhere, she called me crying on 7th October. For a moment, I thought maybe she realized something about us or missed me. I was hopeful. At first, she didn’t tell me why she called and asked me to talk about other things. So, we talked casually—how life’s going, what’s new, etc. She mentioned she’s going to Goa in November and is excited to wear beach clothes. It hurt me, but I tried to keep it together.\n\nFinally, she told me why she called: she had an argument with her new boyfriend and needed someone to talk to. She said, “I mess up everything—with my family, boyfriend, and friends.” She told me all about their fight, which was just a normal couple argument. And then she said, “He’s not a bad guy… the problem is me. I don’t want to mess this up with him.”\n\nHearing her talk about how she’s scared of ruining things with him broke me completely. Where was this self-reflection when we were together? Where was this realization when we were falling apart? I’ve been crying and dying inside every day since the breakup, and now she’s doing everything she didn’t do for me—for him.\n\nAt one point, I told her I trimmed my beard (something she always wanted me to do), hoping to get a reaction. Instead, she laughed and said, “I don’t like shaved guys anymore—I’m into bearded guys now” (her current boyfriend has a beard). That hit me like a truck.\n\nAt the end of the call, she said it was a mistake to call me and that she’d regret it later. She apologized, said I’m not the right person to talk to about her boyfriend issues, and hung up.\n\n26th November 2024 – My Birthday\n\nToday’s my birthday. I turned a year older, but it feels like I’ve lost everything in my life. I just messed up my CAT exam on the 24th, which I’d been preparing for so long, but I couldn’t focus after all that happened. Now I feel like I have nothing—no exam, no career, no friends, no family who cares. No one even wished me today.\n\nShe called me twice today. But I didn’t pick up. I didn’t want her to know if I’m alive, what I’m doing, or how my exam went. I’m trying to shut her out of my life, but it’s tearing me apart.\n\nI know I’ll regret it later—I should’ve picked up her call, right? Why am I being rude to her? I just can’t decide. She’s breaking me every second. I miss her voice, her touch, and just her. I feel like my life has no meaning anymore. I can’t find happiness in anything. Every second feels like another piece of me is being crushed.\n\nI don’t know what to do anymore. How do I stop feeling like this? How do I let go of someone who moved on so easily while I’m still stuck in this endless pain? If anyone’s been through something like this, please help me. How did you move on? How did you deal with the heartbreak, regret, and loneliness?\n\nTDLR: TL;DR:\n\nMy girlfriend left me in May 2024 because she said I didn’t put in enough effort during our long-distance relationship. She quickly moved on and started dating someone new by July, claiming she had lost feelings for me months before we broke up.\n\nI’m struggling to move on, crying every day, and unable to focus on my studies or life. She called me once in October to vent about a fight with her new boyfriend, which broke me even more because she’s doing for him what she never did for me.\n\nI’m stuck in heartbreak and regret while she’s moved on and seems happy. How do I let go and move on?",

My health started deteriorating three years ago, and during that time, my father neglected me medically for over a year. I had severe infections damaging my bladder, and his neglect left me in a much worse condition.\n\nAfter a point, I stood up for myself, got admitted to the hospital (following an attempt), and my father reluctantly began paying for my treatment. Since then, I’ve been trying to manage my health while studying, but the emotional toll has been immense., last semester I mangaed to maintain a 9.3cgoa despite being severely sick\n\nToday, while paying for my medicines, my father accused me of being a \"druggie\" and claimed I was being coerced by friends to give them money. For context, my friends have occasionally helped me cover small amounts for my medicines (e.g., ₹100 or ₹40), which I’ve always repaid on the same day. I’ve also supported them financially whenever I could.\n\nHe threatened to file an FIR against my friends and call my college and hostel to get me removed. He made humiliating comments about my character and accused me of \"enjoying life\" simply because I occasionally use the metro or a bike taxi to commute.\n\nI recently opened a new bank account to have some financial independence, with help from a friend who deposited cash for me because I had forgotten my ATM PIN. My father claims he can access this new account and monitor my transactions, which has left me feeling violated and trapped.\n\nAll my doctors have told me that the neglect and emotional abuse I’ve endured have significantly impacted my physical and mental health. Right now, I’m on antidepressants, which have left me feeling numb, and I’m struggling to process everything.\n\nI feel humiliated, heartbroken, and unsure how to move forward. I wanted to share my story here because I feel so alone in this and don’t know what steps to take next.\n\nCurrently I m in second year of my college , don't know how to start earning early and I m pursuing betch , ik java , learning web development and doing dsa side by side \n\nAny advice or support would mean the world to me.\n\n\n\n\n",

From he past 2-3 years, he's been like this. but problem ye he ki vo ghar aake mummy ko marte he and argument karte he even after she supported him at his worst jab unke parents ne unhe ghar se nkal diya tha. Meri mummy ache se chal bhi nahi pati thi, itne extent tak ghir chuke he vo. but vo kuch bolte nahi just because of me, kyuki my mom is not capable of earning or unhe is baat ka ego he. \"me kamata hu, oro ki bivi dekh kama ke pese lati he\". so day before yesterday I had enough, he was slapping her and I yelled \"oyee! kya kar raha he?\" and my mom was still pushing me saying \"beta chodd chodd tujhe meri kasam\". jate jate mene unhe bola \"kal se agar sharab ayi na is ghar me...\"\n\nvo mere nana ko bhi humiliate karte he but mummy tab bhi kkuch nahi bolti. kal se ye mere piche pade hue he....\"tu marega mujhe? tu?\" \" adami he to ek mahine ka kiraya nikal ke dikha\" We are actually from somewhere else buut are settled indelhii.. he keeps yelling at her ki \"tu ghar kab jaa rahi he? tujhe bilkul bhi sharam nahi he?abhi tak yahi he\"\n\nkal se unhone rephrased kar diya he.....\"tum dono jake mar jao truck ke niche\" and yeah I dont wanna mention the way he curse us. maa behen se bhi upar ki galiya. meri mum ki is admi ne haddiya tak todi hui he or parso se ye meri mum ko bolra he \"tune meri ungli me swelling kara di he\" and then today he proceeded for hurting her finger.\n\nyou know what is more ridiculous? inka pehle bhi divorce ho chuka he and I am actually his second child. ye bohot ganda ganda bolte he mujhe lately and I wont be surprised to know ki ye mujhe ghar se kabhi bhi nikal denge.\n\nyaha tak ki aaj me or meri mum bahar kaam dhund ne gye mum ke liye or mene bhi apne liye search kiya online. me sochra tha mum kuch tailoring kar lengi shayad but mujhe kya bura laga was that my mom said \"jhadu pocha bhi chalega\" unke samne ro tak nahi saka me.\n\nand yeah if you are thinking that we are financially weak then let me tell you that ham utne weak nahi he though we are financially unstable.\n\nmere 12th se end sem ka exam he me or meri mum bahr wale kamre me he or andar wifi he. or mere papa ne andar se wifi band kardiya out of ego ofcourse. ghanta farq padta he ki bache ki back lage. ok ye to kuch nahi. hamare room me jo razai kambal thi vo bhi ye andar legye he. and yeah phones bhi ham dono ke inke pas hi he. but that is least of my concerns for now.(i am posting this from my laptop btw) meri mum ne kal se kuch nahi khaya tha, jab bhi khana banane ki koshish kare tp ye bich me ajate the \"tu yahi he? mujhe bata ghar kab jaygi?\".\n\nguys I want my mum to divorce him but my mum keeps saying \"apne future ka soch\"\n\nSo here are few things that we need to remember before coming into conclusion:\n\nthings in faavour:\n\n1. mere dada ne zameen mere naam kar rakhi he.(idk how much that is though but kafi he)\n2. mere tau ji most probably mujhe support karenge and I have saved him as a last resort.\n\nnot in favour:\n\n1.source of income kuch nahi he except my dad.\n\n2.and if mene kisi ko kuch bataya to ye mujhe ghar se nikal denge.\n\n3. job dhund na kitna mushkil he aaj pata chal gya.\n\n4.\n\nlist lambi he. and agar kisi pe pas contacts he jo meri mum ki job laga sakta he please do let me know. She is not much educated all she can do is day caring for elders or kids just for the day.\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"The reason I posted this was because I wanted to ask some senior professional or any person who has knowledge about what will happen to me and my studies after their divorce.\"\"\"\"\"\n\nI am good at typing and graphic designing stuff.

Or are we introducing yoga sessions on the go? Either way, it’s both amusing and deeply concerning that public transport has reached a point where the floor feels like the only option.\n\nSure, the metro is supposed to be efficient, but maybe it’s time we started focusing on comfort too. Because if this trend continues, I might just pack a cushion for my next ride!\n\n\nShare your experiences or was it just me???? 😪",

        "post": "So my dadaji retired from his job a while ago and all he does now is wake up, do pooja, have breakfast and from then he is glued to facebook and keeps on scrolling reels from lunch to dinner and then until he sleeps. A bit about my dadaji he is an introvert and avoids social settings but can talk whenever he has to, Has a fear that someone is after him and is super paranoid about every little thing that happens(some kinda ptsd), is a chainsmoker and uses mouth tobacco as well to cope ig. The point is it feels kinda sad to just see him all day addicted to his phone and ignoring every other responsibility or goals. Its like he has given up and is just passing his time. I even tried to fix his addiction by deleting facebook and getting him into gaming but that was a thing i regretted cause he was so addicted to fortnite that we would often have burnt pans in our home so we had to get rid of our ps. He refuses to go to therapy and delays going out, refuses to join any club and just wants to be at home. Its not wrong but his addiction is getting bad. I turn to you guys for any kind of tips or advice on what i should do. If you have any experience or similar story do share it. ",

No nothing.** They’re just ignoring me like this is no big deal.

It was nothing major, just stomach cramps (might be placebo because just took a bite) but my anxiety was acting up (she is good now). But this has scared me. This is beyond irresponsible.  \n\nHow can a company sell food like this and then act like nothing happened when someone complains? **I’m beyond frustrated.** They clearly don’t care about customer safety, and they definitely don’t care about their responsibility when it comes to quality control.  \n\nAnd mind you, I didn’t even care about refund, it’s just 80rs each. I wanted to inform them about this but they didn’t even bother to check or ask me batch codes or anything so nobody else gets it.\n\nI’m posting this because people need to know. If you’re thinking of buying from this brand, **DON’T**. Their products are disgusting, and they have zero respect for their customers.  \n\nAlso, here’s https://youtube.com/shorts/8uU6Q4VKgqI?si=86MKS55hLW9heWql a video of how they are a fraud and making false claims on the protein.\n\nI was stupid to throw the stuff, I am buying again and getting them all products tested.

If you’re genuinely interested in joining and willing to step out of your home to attend the meetup, we’d love to welcome you.\n\nInterested? Comment below, and I’ll add you!\n\n",

        "post": "I was observing a girl, looked like 16-17 year old girl. She first gave her seat to this old uncle, around 85-90 years of age. Then his phone was ringing at a very high volume, but due to old age he didnt hear it. She looked like she would burst into tears, probably had a rough day at home or school.. \n\nShe still told him that 'Uncle yur phone is ringing' and had to repeat it 2 or 3 times as he didnt hear her. In todays time children find it awkward or embarrassing to talk to elders. This was at INA stop. His hands were shaking very much to the extent that he couldnt even pick up the call to talk so this girl placed her bag on the floor of a crowded metro and helped him pick up the call and speak to whoever was calling him\n\nShe asked him where he had to go to, Uncle had to get off at Chattarpur. She offered to drop him till there. He said No no I go frequently, almost every week but he was clearly struggling. I asked the girl where she was getting off she said Hauz Khas but she will drop uncle then come back. Which would be 3--4 stations front and back both. \n\nSome guy in the metro remarked that it was Guru Purab, and uncle shd take her help. The girl had tears in her eyes hearing that.. I hope she heals from whatever was hurting her.. More power to her.\n\nI also had to gett of at Chattarpur but I didnt say anything. I feel foolish now.. I noticed she also had a token so it would charge her a fine when she reaches chattarpur and she would have to buy new one\n\nShe exited with uncle, Most kids wud have found this very annoying as uncle was walking very slowly, like baby steps and not much he was saying was comprehensible. She waited with him and then an equally old aunty came. Uncle introduced her to him, that was his wife. She said this girl has helped me come till here and Aunty patted her and said that my husband is so silly sometimes, thank you fr helping him!! They were walking away slowly, very slowlyy like snails but she just stood and watched.. after that she paid fine to get into new metro back to her home (probably).\n\n(Not a creep, I wasnt staring at the girl or anything, I had to go to Chattarpur for some work so I was sitting on the bench at chattarpur while this last interaction happened)",

After a while bro starts reacting to the stuff my friend was saying, and then randomly starts asking questions about the story\nand then asks us where we live, we were both creeped out at this point. We gave him false addresses, false college name and everything. Apparently he was from amity university (makes sense). After a few minutes we were really creeped out and then we started to walk towards the violet line (to completely avoid him, even though we had to go on the pink line) and the man started to follow us, thank god for the over population in Delhi, we lost him in the crowd and then i was so scared of going back to the pink line to head home, i ended up changing my whole route and it took me an hour more and 30 rupees of roaming fee to reach home. I know we should have told him to leave us alone as we were uncomfortable \n(the people pleaser in us wouldn’t let us), but its also completely weird to just start talking to two people you don’t know and the guy also stared at me and my friend in the wrong places and asked a bite from our snacks.

However, recent developments have disrupted our tranquility. As my father, who is over 75 years old, recovers from a heart surgery and manages his heart condition, and my mother, also in her 70s, faces several health issues, maintaining a peaceful environment has become crucial for our well-being.\n\n**The Midnight Disturbance**\n\nNext to our house, a few local restaurants and shops have started selling tea, eggs, parathas, and other items throughout the night. This situation has been a constant source of disturbance, making it difficult for us, including school-going children, to get a good night's sleep. Despite our appeals for them to reduce noise and operate during reasonable hours, these vendors have been uncooperative, openly stating their intention to continue all night.\n\n**Ineffective Law Enforcement**\n\nWhat makes this situation even more frustrating is the apparent indifference of the Maurice Nagar police station, located right across opposite from our home.

Either they don’t respond at all, or I get vague, unhelpful answers like “It will move soon” or “Please wait a few more days.” How long am I supposed to wait without any clear information?\n\nWhat’s the point of having a tracking system if it doesn’t actually provide useful updates? At least with private couriers, you get precise updates and faster responses. India Post’s inefficiency is making me regret ever using their service.\n\nHas anyone else faced this issue? How did you resolve it? Is there any way to escalate this or get a proper response? I feel completely stuck with no options.\n",

When I sat down and look ahead, there's this really cute guy sitting right in front of me and automatically my mouth goes off 'I appreciate a good view'. I've to repeat what I said 2 times for my half-deaf friend, but I'm pretty sure he didn't hear that (not so sure if the people sitting next to me didn't). Anyway, it wasn't that deep. I just thought he was cute, you know that silly crush, random people you see on metro and never again. I didn't make anymore comments about it, at least till he was getting up to leave and it made me sad, so I was whispering 'no' to my friend . Nvm after he leaves I'm wondering if he was creeped out by me. Me and my friend can be loud when we're in public, just minding our business and having fun. It wasn't like we were constantly talking about him or whatever. But our eyes met a few times since he was sitting literally opposite us, and that got me hoping that I haven't weirded a random dude out because I was looking at him cuz I thought he was cute. \n\nBeing a girl who gets a lot of stares in my locality and college, I know it's not flattering when it happens. So just gotta know from you guys, does it make you uncomfortable as well?",

During my time in Delhi, I've changed several homes and not come across this either.\n\nMy rent increase is 5% instead of 10%, and I'm not sure whether this is the landlord's way of extracting extra pennies. Basically, the rent went from 28k to 29.4k, meaning the landlord now wants 1400 bucks extra as deposit continual.\n\nIt's not a large amount, but it's a matter of principle and it's pissing me off. I've told her I will not be paying.\n\nI've now told her I will be vacating, and am afraid that they may withhold my deposit or something because of this.\n\nAny thoughts/advice on how to handle the situation would be of great help.

Now having money from his work he constantly goes clubbing night after night as he got introduced to it last year(just like me) through his mutuals i guess. Now from what i had perceived him before he changed from a understanding chill guy into a guy who hooks up with girls /and gets multiple contacts and says “ girls approach me, not me”. He still had his overall self but due to this clubs n pub scene he has been different and i realised i was intrigued and i too got indulged a bit into that lifestyle due to being in that environment…. It feels good partying but theres also guilt there, as a student the money goes away anyways even if he pays for the drinks on different things. \nWhat made me finally decide to write this silly little confession here was seeing some problems here around themes of OP’s best friends betrayal n such and the thing that happened last night where i was around with him and his “club friend circle” which they only know through going out frequently thus being mutuals. And the thing that gets me disturbed is that the topic always comes somewhere around lighthearted jokes and then my friend puts few jokes/banter on me and then when i hesitate to response boldly (i stutter when full attentions on me) he simply goes forth with “bro you’re not angry right dude? Its not serious” in front of everybody like…. He says he got my back if theres ever a fight but have my back when im also around strangers n support getting the guy comfortable to the crowd. Are these valid questions or am i overthinking here guys? Thanks.",

And I knew I wasn't mistaken because she was sitting right in front of me. And she was talking to it like she was talking to a friend, smiling, giggling, saying things in its ear. I even saw the doll blink its eyes a few times. It also felt like the doll was smiling, although I'm not totally sure about that. And she was also not like a 4-5-year-old girl; she must have been like 15-16 years old. I was a bit shocked and curious as to what was happening because I was witnessing this for the first time. Has any one of you ever witnessed this or maybe know what exactly was happening? \n\nAlso, I know it's a religious topic, so don't take me being shocked in a wrong way. I myself love Lord Krishna and his teachings from the Mahabharata. It's just that I haven't seen anything like this before.",

        "post": "I travel daily by bus from Azadpur Metro Station. There’s a thief there, or maybe more, but I’ve noticed one in particular who’s always there, every single day. From his appearance, he looks like a typical petty criminal. His height is probably between 5'3\" and 5'6\", and his hair is very short. He carries a piece of cloth soaked in some kind of solution, which he sniffs to get high. He also carries a bag slung over his back. At first glance, he might seem like an ordinary young man heading out for a day job. But if you observe him for just five minutes, it becomes clear what he actually is. There’s a police booth right in front of the Azadpur Metro Station (on the Yellow Line), yet nothing happens to these thieves—probably because we all know how \"efficient\" the police are here .That guy tries his best to appear like a regular poor laborer, just like the others, so that no one suspects him. Most of these thieves come from areas like Lalbagh and Jahangirpuri because they know about the crowds at Azadpur’s bus stands. I tried to take his photo once, but I didn’t want to get involved in their mess, so I didn’t.  \nI’ve noticed a pattern in how these thieves operate:1. First, they figure out which buses tend to have more crowded routes, like 78, 442, etc. Then they approach those buses and deliberately ask questions like, \"Brother, does this bus go to Bawana?\" For example, if it’s bus number 78, they’ll go and pretend to inquire about its route.2. As soon as the bus gate opens, they push their way into the crowd. They carry a bag on their back, which literally has nothing in it. When boarding from the rear gate, they take the bag off their back and hold it in front of them. Then, under the cover of the bag, they start taking out people’s phones and wallets.3. Once they’ve stolen the items, they move to their final step. After boarding the bus and stealing the valuables, they ask the conductor about a bus stop where the bus doesn’t actually go. For example, they’ll ask about a random stop, and as soon as the conductor tells them the bus won’t go there, they step off the bus from the rear gate.4. In the chaos of boarding, most people are busy getting tickets or finding seats, so they don’t realize their belongings are missing. It’s only after the bus has moved some distance that they notice, but by then it’s already too late .My advice: You’ll find thieves everywhere in Delhi, but I recommend staying alert at crowded stations like Lal Qila and Azadpur. Also, remember that not everyone who looks like a thief is actually a thief. Nowadays, these people have become smarter, so they dress and act normal to avoid suspicion.",

So I booked my ticket first. When I was booking their tickets, the site wouldn't accept either of their passport numbers because the length was greater than 8 digits. What clownery. \n\nUltimately we got the tickets at the counter where they didn't even ask for the passport. \n\nI can't understand why the government can't make a decent site at least for stuff of international importance like this.

We're struggling to afford her medical tests, ongoing treatment, and manage our family's basic expenses. My mother, despite limited financial resources, always prioritized our family's well-being and education.\n\nEven during this challenging time, my mother worries more about our family's future than her own health. She feels guilty about being a potential burden during her treatment. As the sole breadwinner, I'm trying to balance her medical needs with our family's survival. ***We don't want her medical challenges to derail our family's dreams***.\n\n***We want to support her recovery***, but we can't do it alone. *We've exhausted our savings, My company's medical insurance doesn't support Siddha so we were left with no substantial support. Crowdfunding has become our last hope.* ***Your smallest contribution can help save a loving mother's life and support a family fighting to stay together***.\n\nOur medical journey has been complicated. We've visited multiple hospitals, including government institutions, private hospitals over the 15 years but found only short term relief for mom through the treatment. We then moved to siddha as it really helped prevent her condition from deteriorating further. The road to recovery is long but we are seeing improvments in her condition\n\n***Delaying treatment could increase medical expenses exponentially and reduce the chances of effective management.*** The estimated cost for comprehensive treatment is around 10 lakhs, covering medical procedures, ,ongoing care and the exisiting Medical Debt that we are trying to close ***All medical documents, doctor's reports, and treatment plans are comprehensively available in my profile page (pinned)***.\n\nWe're not just seeking medical support, but a chance to help my mother recover and restore our family's hope. Every contribution matters - financial support, sharing our story, or simply sending positive thoughts or upvoting the post.\n\nDonation Link (Milaap) || Medical Report & Diagnosis Summary || Mom's Latest Medicine Summary ||  \n**Will add in the comments, you can also find them in my profile(Pinned post)**\n\nFor those who want to donate directly and keep their personal information private, I'll share bank and UPI details in the comments. This way, you can contribute without sharing your contact details on the fundraising platform, ensuring every rupee goes directly towards my mother's treatment.\n\nI did post here 3 months ago, but it did not get enough attention , so Im reposting here for more people to share our story",

Everything was going well, but then she went to her village and instead of her, her daughter started coming for work. Soon, I noticed that some money has started disappearing from my bag. Firstly, I thought maybe my mom or dad noticed how badly I keep money in my bag and instead they put it safely in some place (I was really bad at this a while ago). \n\nBut, it soon started to become a constant habit. We suspected it might her who steals the money. So, I set up a secret CCTV camera to check. Soon, it was clearly shown that she was doing all these thefts and we even confronted her about it. She started constantly denying the allegations, but we had full proof , so she had no escape. Afterwards, she didn't came to work. I asked my mother if she told her mother about all these incidents. She did tell her, but for some reason she took this incident very lightly and didn't even asked for the money back. She told me now her mother would be coming to work, so it's fine. I was so upset, even tried to change her opinion, but she was like it's fine.\n\nFor some past days, her another daughter has started coming to work, yesterday I kept my earbuds on my study table, but they have gone missing since morning.

I was never the best in my class and never got 90 percent before 10th grade. I have been obese from a very early age and still weigh about 140 kg. Due to this obesity I have always been bullied throughout my childhood therefore, I have crippiling self-esteem issues.\n\n\n\nI have never known what my passion is or what I like. I have always been told by my parents what to do and not do in my life. My mother is extremely controlling and used to physically abuse me a lot in my childhood. \n\nThroughout my life, I have been struggling with depressive thoughts and episodes of existential crisis. So in 10th, I was sent to a coaching institute in my area. This helped me immensely in my studies and I started to improve in them. Got 90s 95s Throughout 10th. and eventually, I was also sent to the coaching to prepare for NEET 2025. \n\n\n\nI did not perform well in the program from the start and did very poorly in the 11th class. When I came in 12th I thought things would get helpful but now it's still the same.  \n\n\n\nCurrently, I am still completely mind fucked. I am confused why I took up this useless coaching and don't have a clue what or why am i doing it. My prep is also fucked. I am completely lost in this rat race and feel that I have wasted my 3 yrs and my parent's money. I don't think now that the tag of being a doctor is worth it after what has happened to my mental health because of this pressure.\n\n\n\nSo I am 17 and Pls Everyone provide me with some advice on what to do.\n\n\n\nIn the end, I think that I am going to need a fuck ton of therapy after this.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading this vent\n\n,",

I get anxiety attacks when my parents talk about shaadi ka rishta.\n\nI basically do not want to exist. My life has no purpose. My parents have a son and a daughter before me, which was enough. And I hate that they brought me into this cruel world.\n\nMy best friend’s sister died today. She was separated from her husband and left behind two kids. \n\nNow their responsibility is on my best friend, who is herself unmarried. She doesn’t have her father, and she is the most wonderful person I have met. She has done so much for her family, and I only wish good for her. Since her sister is gone, I know that the responsibilities for the kids are going to fall on her. The father of the kids is good for nothing.\n\nNow I feel like I have no purpose on this earth. I have no responsibilities and no one dependent on me. It should have been me. I don’t want this life, but she did. She was living for her kids. God is unfair.\n\nI have no one to discuss what I’m going through. I don’t know if I’m in shock. I’m crying and writing this, so please excuse any errors.",

        "post": "So I had placed an order from Nykaa during the sale last week (28th Nov) and it got delivered on 3rd dec but one of the items was broken and damaged and one was an expired item so I put up a request for replacement of both the items. \n\nAfter that it showed on the app that someone will come to pickup the order on 3rd itself but no one came so I let it go thinking delays happens sometimes. \nThe next day (4th dec), a delivery agent shows up to my door claiming that I should cancel the replacement request and should share the cancel OPT with him. I asked him why should I do that but his response made no sense to me and it was the lines of “the company (Nykaa) replacement policy is bad” so I need to cancel it but I didn’t share the opt and called the Nykaa customer service right then only explaining the situation to them. \n\nWhile I was talking to the customer service representative, the delivery agent left my door and went to stand near the parking and I could see him from the balcony. The customer representative put me hold and contacted him, I could see him answering his phone right infront of me and while talking on the call he casually started keying and scratching my car so I called him out to not do that or else I’ll call the security guard. \nHe started yelling and talking to me from the parking to me (I live on the third floor) I told him not to create a scene in the society and come upstairs to talk but then yelled more and left. \n\nI called the customer service to complain about it and explained the whole situation requesting them to send another delivery agent for the pickup as this isn’t acceptable behaviour. \n\nToday (5th dec) I get a call around the afternoon that I’m here to pickup please come downstairs, it was from those company number hence I answered, I told him that there is a left in the building he can come upstairs easily. He begrudgingly came and then I come to know that it’s the same delivery person from yesterday. \n\nI asked him again why is he here as he refused to pickup the order citing that he can’t pickup anything damaged (the purpose of the pickup was the damaged item so it doesn’t make sense). He then continued to open the products very carelessly citing that he needs to see them, I told him that only one is damaged and other one is expired so you can see the expiration date clearly on the outside box only. He started yelling again that why can’t you just share the cancel opt and I don’t even want to take it. \nHe refused to take the return items again and left yelling and creating a scene yet again. \n\nNow I have contacted the customer service representative at Nykaa about it as the delhivery doesn’t have any customer support at all. They promised to escalate the issue and send someone else but now I scared that they will send him again and my order won’t get replaced. \n\nAlso tbh as being girl staying with only girls im scared for my safety as well. \nPlease let me know what can I do in this situation, I just wanted to return the broken items. I can’t have this happening everyday in front of my house. ",

Unlike platforms like Instagram, which often foster addiction without meaningful interaction, Reddit offers the opportunity to be constructive, to work on personal growth, or even drive change in areas that matter to you. One of its greatest strengths is the absence of features like Reels, which keeps the focus on thoughtful engagement rather than endless scrolling. The day Reddit introduces such a feature, I’d probably reconsider using it. That said, while the adage “If you’re not paying for the product, you are the product” holds true here, it feels worth it for now. Reddit’s community-driven nature and the presence of genuinely good people make it a platform I’m happy to spend time on.\n",

        "post": "In the morning I was tired of asking which is the better place to study and being productive. I asked any library/ affordable co-working spaces etc.\n\nToday, I visited two libraries near Rajiv chowk. Travelled all the way from Rohini/ Pitampura to Barakhamba road. Will be more than happy to help you with all your queries. Just ask in this thread \n\nFor starter, lemme break my experience with both these libraries.\n\n\n✨ AMERICAN CENTER LIBRARY :\nI have to say, the SECURITY. Oh my god, the security was immense. Like they took my adhar card, pan card, before even letting me enter the main gate only. Then inside security room, they asked me to remove my laptop, phone, neckband, keys, everything of metal in separate trays for x ray checking.\nMy god, full Airport checking vibes. Even tight, they ASKED ME TO TAKE A SIP OF WATER FROM MY OWN BOTTLE. I read this same thing with others also (reviews on Google maps).\n\nThen, the main library was small. Like I expected it to be really big, but it's like around 30 people can only sit there. That's it! The librarians were really nice. Not rude, I basically read that American library staff is quite rude than British council staff.\n\nAnd yes, the security guy/receptionist/ corridor guy/ladaaku budhaa proved them right. I asked that guy \"Someone told me that there is also a library on 2nd floor (which was apparently a sitting/reading room, where you read your own books). This budha got no chill and I guess he had fights with her wife at home. But other than those 20 seconds interaction, everything was really nice.\nI mean 400 for a year, even you can sit there without that 400 rs membership as well. It's really calm, very less people, and lots of free space. And the reading room also has some of the best chairs to seat on.\n\nSo only caveat is, you have to deal with security folks, rest everything is BEST. And yes, you can take your laptops also there.\n\n\n\n✨ BRITISH COUNCIL LIBRARY:\nI went there straight. Just a metro- like checking. That's it. The library is comparatively bigger. The receptionist guys were so sweet. It has much more crowd than American one. Hence, a bit noise as well. More books, MORE FEES. In fact, the guy asked me 3000 rs, even though website says, 2500. But I didn't counter question as I didn't want to take the membership.\n\nAlso, here you cannot sit here freely without a membership. I mean, you can buy I read it has some surprise checking where they check your ID cards. \n\n\nI have one question, the entry security was strict, I get it. But while exiting, nobody really cared. Like what if some student takes any library book without permission in their bag? That would be stealing.\n\nIn British council, during exit, I had to pass through a metro like gate , maybe there would be detectors in your books which would beep if you tried to steal, just my assumption.\nBut in American, there wasn't even any such thing. I mean you could take books ig. I hope I am wrong. There needs to be at least something that I didn't notice. Please answer this. \n\n\nRest, if you have any queries, ask in comments ",

        "post": "Imagine a respected professional like *Doctor G*, recently scammed out of a significant sum of money. The scammer, pretending to be a law enforcement official, convinced her she was \"digitally arrested\" and gained her trust by reciting her *exact bank account details*.\n\nAs a concerned citizen, I have questions that deserve answers. I’m not a cybersecurity expert, nor an investigator. I’m just a regular person questioning the system’s integrity. Here's what I need to know:\n\n# 1. How Do Scammers Access Bank Account Details?\n\nAre Indian banks failing in their duty to protect customer information? Are privacy and security becoming a joke? Scammers seem to have easy access to sensitive data—so where are the loopholes? Is it insider involvement, weak cybersecurity measures, or sheer negligence?\n\n# 2. Are Banks Conducting Proper KYC?\n\nBanks claim to follow stringent KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols. Yet, when scammed money is traced to specific accounts, why are these account holders not immediately apprehended? Are loopholes in KYC being exploited, or is it a lack of enforcement?\n\n# 3. Is Police Action Only Triggered Under Pressure?\n\nWhy do victims often feel ignored unless they bring public or political pressure? Shouldn't timely updates and assurances be standard practice? Trust in law enforcement erodes when victims are left in the dark.\n\n# 4. Can Victims Directly Lodge an FIR Against the Scammer’s Account Holder?\n\nWhy isn't there a transparent process allowing victims to file a First Information Report (FIR) directly against the scammer’s account holder? Does bureaucracy shield scammers, or is it a gap in the legal process?\n\n# 5. What If the Police Aren’t Helping?\n\nWhen authorities collect details but remain inactive, what’s the next step? Are citizens supposed to wait indefinitely? Should victims turn to higher authorities, media, or even public protests to get justice?\n\n# 6. Why Can’t Media Cover Scams Like They Cover Elections?\n\nIf media outlets can dedicate entire days to political events, why can’t they spare 10 minutes daily to expose financial scams? Raising awareness would not only educate citizens but also push authorities to act more decisively.",

The world of words is an overwhelming place to indulge yourself into. It brings me profound happiness to read words that form a great story when brought together piece by piece like a puzzle art.\n \r\nReading has always been my go-to-escape from the daily hustles of life. Like how a lot of people workout or sleep to recharge their brain, Reading is my battery to recharge my mind from a long day. A book is soothing and a great companion on daily metro rides. The stress from college melts away and it soothes the mind instantly. Reading a book makes you feel centred.\n \r\n“A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one.\" - George R.R. Martin. This is the only quote I want to live by my whole life. \n\r\nAs I am currently reading “The secret history “by Donna Tartt, I feel an intense captivating feeling by the complex characters and their intricate feelings towards each other. The novel weaves a dark tale of privilege, morality, and the darkness within. To summarize this book in few words: group of elite college students, bound by obsession and intellectual curiosity, commit a murder that forever alters their lives.\n\r\nAfter a long day at college, when I pick up a book, it is simply not a hobby but a part of my well-being. It's my serenity amidst chaos.\n\n\nPlease help and give me an honest review.\r\n  ",

Please advice I'm stranded In nowhere. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: For the full story ,I started driving my scooter only in 2022 before that I had no prior experience, so i didn't knew anything about servicing and maintenance ( I know it's stupid but still people makes mistakes and my father also didn't informed for doing it's regular maintenance and servicing) so In 2022 it was seized for the first time and it's half engine work is done for 2500 rs and the  around 6-7 months later  it's engine was again seized as i used to drive around 50 kms daily on my scooter again and didn't changed it's engine oil(I know I'm damn stupid for driving 😔😬)I got it's half engine work done for the same price in aug of 2023 so after this last engine work was done( both the mechanic said it's valves and pistons will be replaced but I don't think they've replaced anything and the work was done behind me and not in a careful manner) my scooter after 6-7 months i.e from the June July of 2024 wasn't running smoothly, it felt like something stuck in it's gears belt and it wasn't reaching it's full speed, it also making some khrrrrr...!! khrrr... !! noise while driving, it's pickup wasn't smooth or fast , it speed got stuck whenever I applied brakes, so for the next 5-6 months I was driving my scooter in this pathetic condition and the last mechanic started making some pathetic excuses to deny his pathetic repair. So yesterday it finally got seized for the third time again around 30 km away from my home (but I changed it's engine oil only a month ago although a cheap one and didn't drive much so I get it checked by roadside mechanics and when they opened the oil filter rig to check engine oil they found its been dried up and even the residual black oil wasn't much coming out of the oil filter place)and it's kick pedal is stuck completely like it was jammed completely.(Some months ago I get it's roller, variator, pulley, clutch etc checked and they were working fine,seems the fault is in the engine only).\n\nNow some people are suggesting that i should've sold it after it was seized the second time as whenever the engine is opened then it won't Able to work properly and it's compromised some people said to get it's engine flushed or take it to service centre etc.\n\nModel is honda Activa 2009model 110cc and bought in 2010 and it ran around 70k kms",

Here's the response.\n\n\"Oh, you want me to roast you for asking me to roast your imaginary drama? Alright, let’s take this meta-roast to the next level.\n\nFirst of all, the sheer audacity of you sitting there like some kind of roast emperor, commanding me to unleash the fire on fake people in a fake scenario that you conjured up for no reason. You’re out here treating me like a verbal gladiator, tossing me into the arena to eviscerate imaginary peasants for your own amusement. What’s next, asking me to write a diss track about a chair?\n\nAnd let’s not ignore the fact that you’re clearly living vicariously through this nonsense. You’ve got more drama in this hypothetical roast-a-thon than an entire season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. “Roast the girl! No, roast her reply! No, roast me for asking you to roast them!” What are you, the roast inception director? You’re building a whole roast universe, and for what? So you can sit back and laugh like a cartoon villain swirling a glass of wine?\n\nOh, and don’t think I didn’t notice how you’re out here demanding brutality like a medieval king shouting, “More blood for the roast gods!” You’re clearly enjoying this way too much. If sadistic enjoyment of fictional carnage was an Olympic sport, you’d already have three gold medals and be prepping for 2028.\n\nBottom line? You’re over here treating this chat like your personal roast pit while I’m just a humble wordsmith forced to turn your chaotic whims into scorching banter. Congratulations, you’re the roast jester and the roast king all in one—now go ahead and cackle at your own theatrics while I take a moment to recover from this ridiculous circus.\"\n\nDayum. ",

I refused, as I am not, but they got angry with me, calling me a liar and starting to beat me here and there. I fell to the ground. They even picked up stones and branches to beat me for no reason. They tried to hit my left elbow with a big piece of stone.\n\nThey could have done a lot more beyond that, as it lasted for 3-4 minutes.

You can check my timeline for all thr updates in detail. Please see the complete breakdown below. \n\nNote - The remaining amount for post op, recovery care and retests needed is 3 lakhs - (Though it's not urgent as we have atleast 15 days before transplant to raise it but if you guys can donate it will be very helpful for us) \nDonate after reading complete breakdown and when you are satisfied. \n--> UPI: Mishra070471@ibl or Mishra0704@ibl\nAccount Number: 50536663988\nIFSC: IDIB000I012\n\nIf you are donating from India please donate via UPI, as milaap transactions are already in process and can't transfer any more funds before 13-14 December. \n\nDonate through Milaap (linked directly to the hospital and father's account):\nhttps://m-lp.co/vijaymis?utm_medium=whatsapp_status_message&utm_source=app\n\nBreakdown of Donations and Expenses ---\n\nTotal Donations Raised - 9.4 Lakhs\nVia Milaap Donations: ₹8.4 lakh\nVia UPI Donations: ₹1 lakh\n\nDeductions and Pending Amounts\n1. Payment Gateway Charges: ₹19,000 deducted\n2. Under Review for Unauthorized Payments: ₹35,000\n\nExpenses So Far, \n\n1. Advance Deposit to Medanta Lucknow Hospital: ₹4 lakh\n2. Pre-op Medical Procedures and Tests (including HLA for father and aunt): ₹3 lakh\n3. Dialysis, Medicines, and Emergency Hospitalization: ₹1.5 lakh\n4. ₹50,000 already deposited is pending with Medanta for necessary tests. This is the pending amount after initial the pre-op tests.\n\nCheck all the documents about everything mentioned above here --> https://imgur.com/a/nJ0pcTz\n\n(Kindly note) \n1. I am in the process of gathering all bills and receipts. I have every bilI but don't have picture so will update the shared link regularly with both old and new records as I collect/capture them.\n2. While I have screenshots of all UPI transactions and bank statements, I haven't shared them here to respect donors' privacy. However, I can share these details personally upon request, with donor names hidden.\n3. I’ve shared only one dialysis bill as they all look the same. We get 3 in a week, If anyone wants all dialysis, hospital, or medicine bills, I can provide them Personally. (Not added publicly) \n\nPending Transaction - A generous donation of $4,500 (~₹3.2 lakh after deductions) was sent by a kind supporter. This amount has not yet reflected in Milaap, but once it does, it will be transferred to the hospital to complete the required ₹7.5 lakh advance payment for the transplant. Milaap has said it will take atleast 10 to 12 days for funds to get transfer. \nOnce after the $4,500 donation reflects and the required advance payment is secured, there will be a shortfall to cover Post-op care, Anti-rejection medications, Recovery care and retests for which you can help us. I will for sure again provide all the expense update about it too. \n\nThank you for your constant support, I will be more than happy to provide any other documents if you guys want to see. For further information, you can also reach out to Medanta Lucknow Hospital directly.",

My grandpa had cataract surgery, and the doctor asked(basically forced in a sweet way) us to give a Google Maps review with her name. Like, you're a respected experienced doctor bro? What would make you force patients to submit reviews?\n\nThis is happening literally everywhere. I went to LalPathlabs to get a blood test, they wouldn't let me leave without feedback and google maps par review.\n\nWent to replace my JBL earphones under warranty, here they don't even ask for feedback, they will not process and close your job if you don't submit feedback! The feedback form was taken down so she made me put an instagram story saying good things about the centre and she took an photo of my story! Literally nuts. What has corporate employee competition done to this country? This craze for feedback is insane, and they don't even respect your personal space or anything. Like forcing and taking a photo of my instagram story is nuts. This isn't a professional way to go about it\n\nI generally don't mind, a lot of places I have been asked to give feedback but I just leave and don't, it's just too much work. But given how Indians are, they won't respect your personal space and force you to give feedback in front of them. This leads to a problem where you want to give negative feedback (which is quite often)where they keep pestering you ki aisa kyu kiya and waste your time even more.

        "post": "A while back, I set out on a mission to find the best momos in Delhi. Now, when I say mission, I mean it—I don’t mess around when it comes to food! What I discovered along the way was a mixed bag—some places were disappointing, but then there were gems that totally blew me away. Before you read any further and start judging me, I TAKE MY FOOD SERIOUSLY!\n\nOkay, so the two spots stood out: one tucked away in Chanakyapuri and another in Amar Colony.\nBut all this got me thinking. For a city like Delhi, full of hidden treasures—not just in food but also in unique places and experiences—why is it so hard to discover these gems without hours of research (yes, I did the research… Han, mai berozgaar hun. Just kidding, but on a serious note I just love to explore new places and food whenever I get the time).\nThis sparked an idea. What if there was one common platform, built by people like you and me, to uncover and share these amazing finds? A place to explore everything Delhi has to offer, from food to events and everything in between. And this inspired me to build Scaape(clever right... scaape offering you an escape). It’s still in the early stages, but I’m passionate about building something that can truly help people discover new experiences in Delhi and beyond.\nAnd if somehow you got till here, read all the way and what I said resonated with you, feel free to drop a message. I'd love to listen your ideas for this app and build this app together. Right now, I’m looking for someone who can handle the social media of Scaape—help us bring this dream to life, one post at a time.\nCheers guys!",

The 60s to 90s kind. I don't regularly meet people who're into the same. But, wow! So many of you rock the head banging vibe. I'm thrilled. \n\nI have a proposal: Let's make a Spotify playlist where we all contribute. I wanna see where this goes. \n\n\nHere are the RULES: \n\n\nEach one gets one comment to nominate one band and three of their songs. You reply to comments and add more songs to the band. One reply, one song. \n\n(Of course, you can make more comments or suggest more than one song in your reply. Just don't be a dick and shove ten comments with the most popular bands. Give everyone a chance. Break the rule only if you feel your band is underrepresented. Feel me?)\n\n\nI'll sit this Sunday and make a Spotify playlist out of this and share it on this sub. \n\nWhat do you say?\n\n\nTL;DR: I'm trying to make a Rock and metal playlist. Follow the rules above and please participate. \n\nCheers. ",

He used to come home drunk and beat me and my mother up. He used to drink in front of me and never let us sleep telling  us how useless  we were in comparison  to his relatives. He took a huge dowry from my mother's  poor family and still treated them horribly and never let me or my mother visit my grandparents. He never used to take us to hospitals for illness and even when I was almost in my deathbed, he and his family left me be. My mother had to hide me and slip away from their  home to take me to the hospital and that's how I avoided death by a small margin. He didn't let  us in the house for another month for that. He has always been abusive and that caused my mother to run away from the house otherwise he would have killed her. I stay away from his house due to university  and he treats me horribly when I come home and always taunts my mother about how bad she and her family is.\n\nThe actual thing is that my mother's family can no longer  sustain the three of them with their small pension. My father is a extremely  high level government  official (like in the FBI of india) and he doesn't  pay her for a life. She has complained to the government  about everything and they're  on my father's side otherwise  their reputation  will completely  collapse. She has even wrote a letter to the Women's Commission  of India and the Hon'able President  herself but to no avail. We got responses but none of them want to do anything  on this matter and the lawyers  don't  want to take on the case because  he's in a powerful position.  I've already  told my mother that he's destroying  my life rn \n I don't  know when I'll flick and start mutilating  him like an animal for what he did to my family. I've become an horrible person because  of how I was raised and I don't  have empathy or any feelings other than hatred for him. Life has fucked us over.",

        "title": "HELP - Unfair Practices at Delhi Technical Campus (IPU)",
        "post": "Hello, fellow Delhiites\n\nI am a fresher at Delhi Technical Campus, and I wanted to bring attention to some unfair practices being imposed by our college administration. These issues affect not just me but hundreds of other students, and it’s time we unite and take a stand for what’s right. Here’s a breakdown of the situation:\n\n# 1. Unnotified Fee Hike\n\nThe college initially stated the annual fees would be ₹1,52,000. However, after admissions were completed, they arbitrarily increased the fees to ₹1,56,000. Most students have already paid ₹1,52,000, but this sudden hike was never communicated beforehand. Such practices are unethical and create an additional financial burden for students and their families.\n\n# 2. Mandatory Uniforms for Freshers\n\nFreshers are being forced to buy uniforms without any prior notification at the time of admission. This requirement was never disclosed in the admission process, making it feel like another tactic to extract money from students. Uniforms should be optional and, if required, communicated transparently.\n\n# 3. Doubling of Fresher Intake\n\nCompared to last year, the intake for freshers has almost doubled from 360 to 600 students this year. This increase has led to overcrowded classrooms, strained resources, and diminished attention to individual students. It’s clear that revenue generation, not student welfare, is being prioritized.\n\n# 4. Withholding Admit Cards\n\nOur end-semester exams start on **December 12, 2024**, but the college administration is withholding admit cards for reasons unknown. Admit cards are essential for appearing in the exams, and this delay is causing significant stress for students.\n\n# Why This Matters\n\nThese actions are not just inconveniences; they reflect a pattern of exploitation that many students in private colleges face. If we don’t speak up now, this behavior will only escalate, affecting future batches as well.\n\n# How You Guys can help\n\nThere are about more than 600 students in just the 1st year, majority of which are from states like Bihar & UP, almost all the students had to choose this college as it was the last option.  \nstudents are scared to take a stand as there have been a couple of examples of students getting suspended for opposing the administration.   \nthe only solution we have right now is sending an email to the university grievance committee.  \nyou can check out a detailed [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IPUniversity/comments/1h6ejbq/unfair_practices_at_delhi_technical_campus_lets/) i made on r/IPUniversity , the post includes a template email that you guys can send anonymously to the GGSIPU grievance commitee or you guys can just share the original post.  \n**Any Kind of Help is Appreciated**",
