Her FindMyFriends location was recently active so we tried calling and a man picked up and said he had found the phone and was near Penn Station.\n\nWe rushed over and found him and he handed it back straight away. It was clear from his appearance that he was homeless (which he also told us). He didn't ask for anything, and at no point did he even hint that he wanted a reward.\n\nWe talked for a few minutes and learned a bit more about him, and I gave him the cash I had on me as a thank you. It wasn‚Äôt much and I wish we could have done more. \n\nI just wanted to share something positive amongst the doom and gloom we see sometimes on Reddit.

        "post": "Six months ago, I was appointed by the Manhattan Borough President as one of fifty volunteer members of Manhattan Community Board¬†8 (CB8), which covers the Upper East Side and Roosevelt Island. After spending dozens of hours on board business, I‚Äôve had time to reflect on my experience ‚Äî and on New York‚Äôs community board system in general.\n\n(To preface, this post is my opinion alone, and does not represent the official position of CB8!)\n\nHere are some key reflections:\n\n* **The community board members I‚Äôve met care deeply** about the city and its residents.\n* **We spend a lot of time on hyperlocal issues**, sometimes with limited broader relevance. Much time is spent debating issues that impact a single business, building, or city block.\n* **CB8 sometimes struggles to reach consensus** on complex, divisive topics. It took CB8 19 hours of meetings to agree on our position about the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity reforms, which is a lot of volunteer time to spend.\n* **The board appears to be out-of-step with local demographics and public opinion** in some important ways. CB8‚Äôs demographics skew older (46% are 60+) and wealthier (60% are homeowners). Renters and younger residents are particularly under-represented. This might contribute to the board taking positions that don't match the broader district‚Äôs views, like lukewarm support for housing reforms and transit upgrades.\n\nDespite these difficulties, there's still a lot of great work that the volunteer board members do, and I've really enjoyed getting to know them.\n\nTo help the board be more representative, responsive, and streamlined, I'm currently exploring:\n\n* How community boards could use **opinion polling** to capture more representative community perspectives\n* How community boards could adopt **general policies** that get automatically applied to frequently recurring topics\n\nI'd be curious to hear from any other New Yorkers who are either community board members or have attended a community board meeting about your experience. What have you appreciated, and what would you like to improve?",

        "post": "In the mid-1800s, Clinton Hill in Brooklyn was once home to Mollie Fancher, a woman famous for spending 50 years in bed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wrpxc8f5k2e1.jpg?width=632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aef30d3ba45eecf39bc6ccf78669bacfdf018110\n\nAfter an unfortunate series of accidents involving repeated blows to the head, Mollie fell into a nine-year trance during which she wrote more than 6,500 letters, crocheted over 100,000 ounces of wool, and created numerous ‚Äúdecorative waxwork flowers and leaves.‚Äù She even sewed a quilted lining for her own coffin. She somehow managed to do all this while her right arm was frozen behind her head and her fingers clenched tightly together.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/azy04f366k2e1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3980499d6c4793263e9ec769f01eaf316ddc96b5\n\nWhen she emerged from her trance, Mollie had acquired supernatural abilities that earned her the nickname ‚ÄúThe Brooklyn Enigma.‚Äù She was said to see through walls, read books by touch, and survive on minuscule amounts of food. During one seven-month stretch, she reportedly consumed just ‚Äúfour teaspoons of milk, two teaspoons of wine, one small banana, and one cracker.‚Äù\n\nHer peculiar talents drew the attention of P.T. Barnum, who offered her a gold-plated bed and a mattress stuffed with swan‚Äôs-down if she would tour with him. Mollie declined.\n\nAs time went on, her powers faded. She gained weight and lost her abilities, but she remained confined to her bed until her death in 1916. The Brooklyn Enigma is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery.\n\n[Brooklyn Public Library, Center for Brooklyn History ](https://preview.redd.it/tj4diy3t5k2e1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48140ff4ed6cece51472d75f4f927743831bb962)\n\nI wrote more about Mollie and the rest of Clinton Hill in my weekly neighborhood newsletter here if you are interested in checking it out: [https://theneighborhoods.substack.com/p/clinton-hill-brooklyn](https://theneighborhoods.substack.com/p/clinton-hill-brooklyn)",

There's more to that which I won't spoil for now, but despite every friends insisting that I stay and pursue because it takes time (while a lot of their own friends or colleagues who are also leaving), we are now finding near impossible to stay. I'm not talking about complicated like in Paris, Berlin or Tokyo where I've lived, or very hard like in London, but straight just unmanageable.\n\nI also know that New York as lost close to a million inhabitants since covid and still as a net loss which is unheard of for a major city, so that makes me feel less crazy and yet we would have loved to stay but: how are people managing to live here, at least survive and find housing, AND isn't there any regulation against discrimination with housing that we can refer to regarding what just happen to us and has really demoralized us in trying to stay?  \nThanks",

I‚Äôd be moving away from family and sacrificing my own space living alone. Also, I have made friends in Brooklyn so it‚Äôs an opportunity to build on the connections I‚Äôve made and start a new life. What would you do? ",

Three things stood out\n\n1) As far as I know, there was no page for a doctor despite me requesting one after the 911 call. I had to start screaming at the top of my lungs for a medical doctor in the terminal. (I was lucky - multiple passengers were EMTs, nurses and doctors.)\n\n2) Airport staff did not know where the AED was. Again I had to run screaming ‚ÄúI need an AED‚Äù for several minutes before another passenger found it.\n\n3) It took 40 minutes to get the EMTs through to the gate. They apparently had to go through the front like regular passengers. It was chaotic and I just feel lucky that other passengers with medical experience were basically able to take charge of the situation during the 40 minutes.\n\nThere was no one working at LGA seemed particularly on top of things or trained for an emergency.\n\nI‚Äôd like to give LGA some feedback, especially on the AED issue.\n\nThe regular complaints line? The MTA? The Governor‚Äôs office?\n\nThanks \n\nETA - if you were one of the doctors, nurses or EMTs traveling that day who stopped to help us, including with the pulse ox and oxygen, thank you! \n\nThe neurologist does not think she has brain damage and that especially oxygen a stranger provided us helped",

        "title": "Lessons from Early Voting that May Help You on Election Day ",
        "post": "Pollworker here who worked ALL of early voting (110 hours over 9 days straight) in Manhattan. Our site was slammed the first weekend with a line down the block. Had some intermittent lines outside through the week & we were busy this past weekend. Our site processed over 18,000 voters.\n\nMost voters were very pleasant, nice, & had no problems/issues voting. We had a few people (3-4?) that had to be asked to remove their political stuff (hats, pins, pamphlets) before entering the site. Had a couple of people who made comments about ‚Äúhoping T wins‚Äù & hoping their vote is counted & that there are no vote counting shenanigans.\n\nFor the record, NYC has one of the safest, most accurate voting process in the country. Believe me, the laws, rules, guidelines, & procedures are many & very thorough. The challenge for us is that because there are so many scenarios & procedures for them, we have to know a lot of stuff & be able to recall INSTANTANEOUSLY what to do for what we‚Äôre presented with. We have more time to deal with this kind of stuff during Early Voting & that‚Äôs why the most experienced, long-term workers work during Early Voting (& they‚Äôll be in poll sites on Election Day).\n\nSo if you missed EV & will be voting on Election Day, please be patient with the folks you deal with. We‚Äôll make EVERY EFFORT POSSIBLE to make sure you‚Äôre able to vote. It is extremely rare that we would actually turn someone away. PLEASE come out to vote, bring a voting buddy, bring your kids & teach them how our voting process works (yes, we have specific stickers for the kids).\n\nALL Election Day polls open at 6:00 am & close promptly at 9:00 pm. If you ARE IN LINE AT 9pm, you WILL be able to vote. If you show up & get in line after that, you‚Äôve missed the opportunity to cast your ballot.\n\nMost common problems we saw during Early Voting:\n\n1.\t‚Å†People did not register to vote by 10/26. You‚Äôve missed this election, but PLEASE register for the next one. Want to know if you‚Äôre registered? Go to VOTE.NYC & you can see if you‚Äôre registered.\n\n2.\t‚Å†Wrong addresses (including just the apt number). You CAN still vote at the poll site using an affidavit ballot.\n\n3.\t‚Å†Wrong poll site. Go to VOTE.NYC, check if you‚Äôre registered to vote & click the link to see your ASSIGNED voting location. You MUST vote at your assigned voting location. If you want to complete an affidavit ballot at the poll site you go to that is not your assigned poll site, your vote will not count.\n\n4.\t‚Å†You requested a mail in/absentee ballot & either didn‚Äôt get it or you haven‚Äôt sent it in. You CAN still vote. IF you still have your absentee ballot at home, fill it out & drop it off at ANY NYC poll site without waiting in line. This is your BEST option, believe me. Otherwise, we can use the affidavit ballot process which will take longer to complete.\n\n5.\t‚Å†Signatures. Once we find you in the poll book, you‚Äôll be asked to sign the iPad tablet with your legal signature (like we‚Äôd see on your license or passport). We do NOT need to see your ID. We match your signature to what we have on file. That could be from a voter registration form, the signature on your NYS drivers license, or a signature from a previous election. We know it won‚Äôt be an ‚Äúexact‚Äù match & we‚Äôre trained to look for a similarities where we can match the signatures to what we have on file. No, we can‚Äôt show you what we‚Äôre looking at before you sign because we can‚Äôt see the signature on file until AFTER you sign the screen. Don‚Äôt worry; we‚Äôll give you another opportunity or two to match them. But please, no ‚Äúgrocery store‚Äù signatures, bar tab closing signatures, or simply squiggles because you‚Äôre in a hurry. We WILL look & it MUST match (reasonably). And if your signatures don‚Äôt match, we have a form for that & you‚Äôll still be able to vote.\n\nSEE YOU AT THE POLLS!",

It‚Äôs beyond frustrating, and it honestly feels deceptive. Far too often, people end up unknowingly tipping double, and the worst part is that many places don‚Äôt even bother to inform us, even though they know it‚Äôs happening and that it‚Äôs wrong.\n\nThere really should be a law requiring businesses to make it clear when a tip is already included. I‚Äôm all for tipping well when it‚Äôs deserved, but I also believe in transparency. Customers shouldn‚Äôt have to comb through their receipts just to avoid being taken advantage of. If you‚Äôre already paying a service charge, you deserve to know before you end up tipping twice.\n\nBusinesses that keep this hidden need to be held accountable. At the very least, it should be standard practice to clearly inform customers upfront, so we can make an informed decision.",

He‚Äôs told me endless stories of heroism, apathy, magic and sometimes just being a genius. He taught me how to navigate the real world and had faith in me when nobody else did. I owe the success of my current life to this person, and in turn I want to make sure I have his full story. I asked a lot through my life but his mix of humbleness & purposeful misdirection I never got to be the verbal archivist I‚Äôd hope to be. I have his badge numbers and the cases he has as a part of. After he left the department he became a freelance forensic cartographer commissioned by the department - one of the first/only I believe. \n\nI just want to understand his story better - he was buddies with Commissioner Kelly who is impossible to contact. I just want to find ways to keep his memory alive through stories, history and his absolute magic which he bright the department (in his own unique way - he apparently broke rules but got the job done!)\n\nIf anyone knows where I can go, if anyone has someone in the department who worked before 1984, or who to speak to other than NYPD personnel, I‚Äôd be forever grateful.\n\n",

We didn‚Äôt want to do all that so just figured we would get a yellow cab downstairs. Got in the first one and as soon as we pulled out the fare jumped to $20+. I asked the driver why this was and he didn‚Äôt have a direct answer, at first he said it was airport fees but the airport fee is clearly listed. When I pointed this out, he didn‚Äôt know what to say and kept saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. Mind you, we were only going to Hollis in Queens which is about 6 miles away. \n\nBy the time we reach our destination, the fare is almost $60!!! I again confront the driver about this and say that the meter is $.70 per 1/5 mile so I should only be charged around $30. I think at this point he realized he couldn‚Äôt take advantage of me and apologized and said it was his first day driving a yellow cab (LOL, sure) and that he didn‚Äôt know. We ended up paying $35 cash and he was pissed about it. He definitely thought we were tourists and was trying to swindle us.\n\nI‚Äôm sharing this so people are aware. I looked up the taxi cab fares on the nyc.gov website and was ready to file a complaint with the TLC but I think my confronting the driver scared him. When in doubt, say something!  ",

There was no drivers, the lift gate was down, and the back was open. Then I noticed the front and back of the truck had different plates and the front plates were fake (they were laser printed on paper).\n\nJust to give context, justice ave leads to the 2nd entrance/exit to the packing garage for the mall so traffic is heavy.\n\nI took photos and submitted a 311 report. I clearly said the road was blocked and the plates were fake.\n\nPolice never came.\n\nThis morning I received an update stating\n\n**The Police Department responded to the complaint and with the information available observed no evidence of the violation at that time.**\n\nThe truck left about 1 hour after I filed the 311 complaint. During that time the police never came.\n\nSo yeah, if they showed up 5 hours later it is true the traffic blocking truck with fake plates was gone, but there needs to be at least some sense of urgency.\n\nNOTE: I'm posting the image of the truck but not the plate because I'm going to pursue this further.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qur1b5lb1rrd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14855a4e1340713632c9a507d1bb3027c8ff6dc9",

        "post": "A few months ago, while I was searching for a temporary place to stay in New York, my friend and I developed a Facebook parser to automate the process. This parser automatically scans the FB Marketplace and compiles the results into a Google Sheet, featuring new sublets in New York. Several users of this Google Sheet have mentioned to me that although the document is valuable, it's difficult to navigate.\n\nResponding to feedback, we were inspired to create free a mobile app with a newsfeed reminiscent of Instagram, where new listings are displayed in chronological order. If you're still on the lookout for a place in New York and are interested in exploring an app that lists all properties in chronological order, please check out the links below:\n\nFor iPhone and iPad:¬†[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/findsublet/id6498717391](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/findsublet/id6498717391)\n\nFor Android:¬†[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tfindublet.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tfindublet.app)\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or suggestions on how to further improve the app!",

        "title": "Interim N.Y.P.D. Commissioner Says Federal Agents Searched His Homes",
        "post": "The Corruption in this administration does not end!\n\nNew York City‚Äôs interim police commissioner said late Saturday that federal agents had searched his homes and seized material from them the day before.\n\nThe interim commissioner,¬†[Thomas G. Donlon](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/thomas-donlon-nypd.html), whom Mayor Eric Adams chose to lead the Police Department only¬†[nine days earlier](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html), said the search warrants executed by the agents were unrelated to the department, which has been caught up in a series of federal criminal investigations that are swirling around the mayor‚Äôs administration.\n\n‚ÄúThey took materials that came into my possession approximately 20 years ago and are unrelated to my work with the New York City Police Department,‚Äù Mr. Donlon said in a news release issued by the department shortly after 11 p.m. ‚ÄúThis is not a department matter, and the department will not be commenting.‚Äù\n\nMr. Donlon did not offer details about the materials that were seized, nor did he say how many homes had been searched or where they were. Nor was it clear which agency conducted the searches; the F.B.I.‚Äôs New York office said early Sunday that it would not comment on the matter.\n\nMr. Adams did not address the investigations on Sunday during his radio show, ‚ÄúHear From the Mayor‚Äù on WBLS.\n\nMr. Donlon‚Äôs predecessor, Edward A. Caban, resigned after federal agents seized his telephone on¬†[Sept. 4](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/banks-sheena-fbi-search-nyc.html).\n\nThe Police Department¬†[is under scrutiny](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/nyregion/nypd-commissioner-caban-adams.html)¬†in one of at least¬†[four federal inquiries](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html)¬†buffeting Mr. Adams‚Äôs administration. The investigations have involved searches and seizures targeting high-ranking officials, including Mr. Caban. The specter of the police-related investigation cast doubt on Mr. Caban‚Äôs ability to supervise a department of more than 30,000 officers.\n\nHe resigned on Sept. 12, saying the investigation had become a distraction. The administration had sought his resignation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMr. Donlon, a Bronx native, has a long background in federal law enforcement, including with the F.B.I. He has served in counterterrorism jobs domestically and abroad and in security for Wall Street firms. Most recently, he ran a private security and consulting company, Global Security Resolutions, that he founded in 2020.\n\nIt is unclear what job Mr. Donlon may have held when the material the agents sought came into his possession.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2003, he was in charge of the F.B.I.‚Äôs New York Counterterrorism Center, and he worked for the agency‚Äôs National Threat Center until 2005, according to a news release from a New York State Senate committee that later vetted his nomination¬†[to lead the state‚Äôs Office of Homeland Security](https://www.riverdalepress.com/stories/riverdale-resident-appointed,40114). Mr. Adams, a state senator at the time, led the committee. In 2005, Mr. Donlon joined Credit Suisse.\n\nWhen Mr. Adams announced Mr. Donlon‚Äôs appointment as interim commissioner this month, he called him ‚Äúan experienced law enforcement professional who has worked at the local, state, federal and international levels.‚Äù\n\nMr. Donlon, for his part, promised to ‚Äúuphold the highest standards of integrity and transparency.‚Äù",

Yes I know they said 10 mph over triggers the camera but do people realize it is very easy to go from 25mph to 40? much easier than 55 to 70. I paid the ticket bc its not worth my time but this is making me really dislike nyc, adams and that commissioner of transportation. if anyone know of any platform i can file a complaint, please lmk. i personally dont think 38 in a 25 is too fast. also i was on the west side highway today and my iphone gps kept saying, red light camera ahead and camera speed zone ahead so i kept looking at my speedometer bc i DO NOT want to speed to much and this is making my driving more stressful and more likely to get into an accident imo. Ive been driving over 30 years and NYC is further going down the drain. im all for slowing down but come on, give us a little more than 10 mph grace. I gonna try my best to avoid NYC!!\n\nwow just honestly stating my opinion and all the hypocrites coming out in force like do you guys really drive at the speed limit all the time? you have proven to me i really dont want to be in nyc. so many things wrong with nyc and i can see why. you guys act like you all drive at 25 mph in a 25mph zone so keep telling yourself that. every time i follow the speed limit exactly i get tailgated. tell me that never happens to you??\nand can we please stop calling people names?",

        "post": "Tldr: Bought my car in Queens in 2020. Moved to FL later that year for some schooling. Reg expired 02/2022. Same tickets, dozens of times. Now I can't reregister my car until all the tickets are paid.\n\nEdit: My wife underwent three surgeries in 2021 that cost our insurance company $600,000. Out of pocket, we had to pay $6,000. We didn't have it. Nursing her back to health ‚Äî she weighed ~130 lbs and is now 97 lbs ‚Äî has been a challenge because she can't work and I'm the bread winner. I am a disabled veteran and receive GI benefits while in school and disability from the VA. I graduate with a BS in mechE next semester and she's a psychology freshman. This arrangement allows me to spend a decent amount of time home and care for her, therefore I do not have a full time job. This is our predicament. We were slumped and all I'm asking for is fucking advice. We're tired. \n\nMain post:\n\nI moved back to NY after transferring schools in August ofn2020. That very same night I got two tickets for registration and inspection. I'm a veteran, so I get paid the first of every month by the VA for disability and and GI benefits while attending school. Those first tickets I got were late August so thought I'd have them handled by payday the week after. However, I got a couple more tickets in the following days and with them, bills, and moving expenses it became ridiculous. I came up with a plan to handle them all the same and got everything got even more ridiculous. \n\nTickets here, there, late fees for the earlier ones and soon it all snowballed. I owe an unmentionable amount. \n\nThis past Thursday, I got two tickets for the same reason. Went to the gym yesterday, Friday, and another two. Then my wife comes home - she doesn't drive, took the train home after school - and walked in with two more tickets for the same thing. \n\nIs there anything I can do to have the amount I owe reduced or eliminated? And if so for either, what must I do?\n\nThanks. \n\nEdit: where is the confusion in any of this? I just needed some simple advice. Am I offending any of y'all by asking a question you all could've just simply strolled on by? Irl, I was told by an officer that I could fight the duplicated tickets as a judge may see that issuing more tickets makes correcting the problem harder. A commenter here stated that I could be put on a payment plan which could fix the problem and that even the comptroller holds an extreme amount of ticketing debt. That's helpful. \n\nCan y'all not attack me or ask mean spirited rhetorical questions? Who's that really helping? ",

        "post": "One of my most vivid 9/11 memories actually took place on the night of 9/12. I was a police first responder from Brooklyn and we'd been on site since the early morning digging through the pile. I burned my hand and was on my way back to work from the medical facility that was set up in the AmEx Building when I saw her.\n\nShe was girl, probably about 18, in an Outback Steakhouse uniform standing out on a clear patch of West Street doing her best to keep dust from falling on the steak sandwiches she was trying hand out. I could not tell you what she looked like, how tall she was or even what race she was.  \n\nYou need to know this - I was a Brooklyn cop for 15 years at that point and while nothing could have prepared me for those days, I had a context for sudden violence. I had developed over the years a professional scab that most street cops have that worked to protect me. \n\nThis kid? Not a chance. At 18 she might have processed her first heartbreak, but this? No way. I had seen the look her eyes before on other people and knew she was beyond her breaking point but there she stood, this sort of beacon among this swirling mass of men and machinery and their grim work. Not a decent soul would have blamed her if she broke and ran, and yet she stood there with us because, if I'm right about people like her, it was where she HAD to be.\n\nIn the 23 years since, I have prayed for that kid every night that she went on to live the good life she deserves and that life has treated her kindly. I hope she is untroubled by the things that she saw that night and can take comfort in knowing that she stood up and was counted. \n\nAnd I hope she knows the great comfort she has given to me over the years knowing that people like her are in the world. \n\nBe kind to each other and never miss a chance to do a little bit of good in this world.",

One problem is I can‚Äôt even access the New York health government website, I don‚Äôt know if this is because I am out of the country, I would assume so. Another issue is that I don‚Äôt know if the basic New York health insurance qualifies me for a waiver, or I need a special plan. I am a low income student so I am trying to not have to pay the Columbia‚Äôs automatic insurance that for me is unaffordable. Next is the issue of timing. In Germany when you sign up for health insurance it is pretty much automatic, it does not take months to become active, it‚Äôs pretty quick but then you are paying for it- I made the mistake of thinking it would be similar so I waited until the month before to enrol. It turns out that when I enrol today my insurance won‚Äôt begin until the next month, but Columbia wants prove that I am insured from the 15th of this month until next year to wave the plan. I am insured in Germany now, but this won‚Äôt work for me after leaving the country. I was told by the office that I could have some sort of letter- does anybody know how to navigate this? If anyone knows anything I would be so eternally grateful since this is really stressful. I reached out to the office and they weren‚Äôt very helpful. Thank you.\n\nEdit: I have medical in the state of Los Angeles, does that qualify for Columbia? ",

        "post": "I visited New York once before. \n\nSaw the Statue of Liberty from a boat, went up to the Empire State Building, saw the one World Trade Center, walked around on the high line, ate chicken and waffle, saw a free music concert in Harlem, walked across Brooklyn bridge, saw a bit of jazz, rode a bike around Central Park, and did a food tour.\n\nNow I‚Äôm heading back, this time for a week as part of a work trip. I will have 1.5 complete free day and 5 evenings. Any suggestions on what I should do ? \n\nThis time I‚Äôd like to do less of the touristy stuff and just enjoy my time there. I want some great New York food, especially your pizzas which I have heard so much about. I‚Äôd also love to find a quiet spot to watch the city go by. And that‚Äôs it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm hoping yall can help me with more ideas!",
