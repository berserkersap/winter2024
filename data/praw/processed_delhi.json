        "text": "encountered a creepy man jerking off at 10 pm on road last night what can i do i had my volleyball tournament last night which ended at 9 pm letting this information be known so that noone comes at me asking what were you even doing out on the road at 10 pm i took metro safely travelled and reached my station at 10 pm from there i decided to book an uber i live around 20 25 minutes away from metro station it wont be an exaggeration to say that i was beyond anxious after leaving metro because it was my first time being out on the road this late at night and that also all by myself as a teenager outside metro station i couldnt see a single lady men everywhere anyways i decided to book a car because i thought a car driver would be more trustable than an auto rickshaw driver auto mein thand lagti hai so there s a small park type thing with trees nearby the main road i stood outside that place facing the main road waiting for my uber i turned back and i spotted a man inside that park type area facing me creepily i have no idea how he got there i squinted my eyes and saw him vigorously moving his hands up and down below his stomach my brain was fogged and processing information very slowly but i was definitely creeped out by the sight and my first thought was that its a ghost because i grew up listening to my grandmother s ghost stories then after a few minutes it hit me what he was doing with his hands and i sprinted away from him i was disgusted and scared beyond imagination i felt like every man in the vehicle passing by was eyeing me as i waited for my uber and the way i was getting eyed it was definitely not out of concern i found out from one acquaintance that the creepy man has been spotted there a few times this month and that place has two schools nearby every afternoon kids pass by that area and you know what agitated me to the point of tears the speculation that he is a school bus driver anyways uber showed up the guy minded his own business i minded mine and i felt so grateful for getting bare minimum basic human decency i made it home safely today i told the entire incident to one of my friends and she scolded me for taking an uber car alone at my night she once did the same and the guy had a kept a gun a real gun with him aage although the driver didnt do anything to her but still why was an uber driver casually carrying a gun with him but then again anything is possible in delhi anyways she reasoned that auto is safer because its open but the point is that cant such men like that creepy jerking guy be reported and taken away little kids pass by that area and he is out there performing such acts will i be listened to if i go to police station alone to get a complaint written against that man i am not aware about the procedure i just want to do my part and take some action against that man what can i do edit a lot of people here told me to just not travel alone at night but what could i have done here in this situation i wasn t aware ki tournament itna extend ho jayega i was there from 11 am and my coach was reluctant to let me leave in between the tournament they bluntly said no as it was an important tournament the only option i had was to travel back alone since i had noone who could pick me up my mother was out of town and i had my 12 year old sibling at home noone else i just want to say that sometimes it s unavoidable to not travel at night alone as a girl what do we do then",
