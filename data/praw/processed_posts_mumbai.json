even invited me to his wedding festivities only for wedding and that also because he needs another car in case of need for baarat and relatives his other friends were invited and are invited in all functions big or small i met him a couple of days back and he did not even mention any of the functions happening we have been bestfriends since 20years plus and i do not even know how to comprehend this i feel betrayed and hurt got hurt by a friend i never expected edit update i attended the wedding i was the first friend to reach to his place helped with all the arrangements did pick ups for all his relatives looked after him he asked me to bring my car bcs i did not take it i brought my car then though conflicted took him another friend of his and his brothers went to venue 1 helped him out over there as he had a very long photoshoot there i was completely occupied with coordination arrangements providing locations other things through the whole time his group of friends turned up quite later i was juggling everything being the point of contact with event mgmt bride s family grooms family and plenty of other guests and friends the friends were there only for instagramable photos and videos of them the groom and them and the bride and them we were late for the baarat rushed him looked after all his valuables and stuff needed for the wedding ceremonies reached almost in time for baarat let me tell you baarat was dull af i quite literally was feeling so bad there was no energy no excitement i jumped in with all energy to bring the vibe pulled his cousins older relatives friends and danced like anything it was so good to see him happy he smiled the first time through the whole day till then i was by his side from the early morning all the ceremonies for entry and other things happened then there was the dream romantic moment varmala we head inside to proceed with other ceremony and pooja i was handling multiple things catering maharaj seating event mgmt valuables gifts etc the couple was drained bcs of the heat and constant ceremonies without any break they requested for refreshments multiple times to the group of friends who were with them when they were seated for the ceremonies while i was running to get people parents uncle aunties needed for poojas and handling catering to get it ready for lunch as guests started to flow in the couple s need was not even heard by this group when i came to them to update on certain things they were literally looking half dead snd and were like kuch bhi leke aa khane please i was so angry at that point ki kya chutiye log hai their friends could not they just signal a waiter and ask for refreshments i arranged for a full time waitress near the bride made 4 people guard 2 access paths to the couple as people were walking and standing in between and blocking their view and disrupting flow of people s movement then comes the joota churai and pheras i was his anwar and was right with him all the time made him and bride laugh we got great pictures the pheras was a bang so much fun enjoyed so much we were actually dancing between the pheras as the bride had selected a playlist to play specifically and the families were performing there was a moment after phera where i almost was caught in cross fire by multiple cousins of the bride who tried to steal the joota from me they failed i was dragging 7 people kind of felt like sunny deol from gaddar when i saw the actual video of this incident the group of friends of his and the bride were completely occupied with their immature jokes and gossips about concerts they were least bit attentive to the needs of the couple and the festivities they were just buzzing like paps on specific moments to capture the moment and then back to discussing about captions filters etc to post on instagram they left after the pheras and did not even stay till the bidai i felt terrible what is this who does this you do not expect this from your close friends i was then again occupied with other errands like getting older people and other guests to groom s home station or hotels getting dining setup for the big family dinner bringing in gifts etc i stuck around helped with packing loading stuff back into the cars surprisingly he noticed i was not there at the dining table so he called me to join his family for dinner i had a hilarious moment at the dining table i was served a piece of sandwich and right then at that instant comes the cameraman putting his camera into my face and i started laughing i told bhai meme baneyga kya mera dost ki shadi me dost sandwich me concentrate kar raha hai p s we did not get to eat anything except a few starters from 8am till 7pm took the bride and the groom and his parents in my car to his place again took all the stuff from multiple cars up to his home sorted them out again informed everything to his parents then there were some pooja to be done to welcome the bride to her newly wedded home sat finally had small talks with his relatives the best part of the day was when his grandparents thanked me and gave me their blessings for being there the whole day and helping them his parents and relatives also acknowledged that and asked me about our friendship like are you college friend or school friends they were surprised that we are friends over 20 years then he called me to his room to sit with him and the bride we were just chilling and having fun gossiping about some weird stuff at the wedding and they were teasing me ki agla number tera hai koi pasand aayi kya aaj etc etc i told him i will take your leave now by then i was with him over 14 hours that is when he hugged me and thanked me i was happy for him and i was happy that i did go and did not miss out on his special day his thanks was not what i was working for but that was a moment an indication of respect and value for this friendship i loved doing every bit of things i did today in his wedding i did not do for his appreciation or respect i had a duty farz as a brother i hope i did justice to it he is a married man now i just hope to see him regularly and wish him a happy and healthy married life",

        "text": "incident with uber driver this is a long read so apologies for that you can skip to the bottom for a tldr my aunt was traveling out of mumbai today and i decided to drop her off at the airport as this was her first time on a flight out of mumbai i booked an uber and the driver came the fare that was shown was 238 rupees 1 he was not the person shown in the app i questioned him about that and he said the car s owner was someone else i have encountered this before so i let it slide first mistake 2 i started loading the luggage in the car while my aunt gave the driver the otp i asked her to wait but she was jittery and wanted to make it to the airport on time 3 my aunt realized she had forgotten her glasses so i rushed back home to get them 4 once the cab began to move i made the second mistake i did not check if the ride had started my aunt was nervous about the travel so i was trying to calm her down this diverted most of my attention off the app and to my aunt 5 once we arrived at the airport the driver showed me the fare was 475 rupees i told him that was incorrect and opened the app to show him and then realized that another ride had already been booked this happens automatically when the driver cancels the ride if he has not started it 6 on noticing his phone i realized he was showing me a screenshot and not the ride complete screen on his app 7 by now my aunt started panicking about her flight so i feigned ignorance and told him to let me drop her off at the counter and i would come back and make the payment 8 while i dropped off my aunt calmed her down and wished her goodbye this dickhead was happily waiting in the cab for me 9 after i got back i showed him that there was another booking that was automatically done he blamed me for double booking i canceled that ride and had to pay the cancellation charge 8 i told him that double booking is not possible and i know how uber works and asked me to show the payment page again he showed me the screenshot which i pointed out 9 he said he takes screenshots of all his payments i asked him why was the screenshot taken somewhere between andheri and the airport was further from it as in why was the trip completed there he started mumbling some nonsense and he knew he was caught i told him to show me his ride history which he did and it only showed on trip and that was not mine he told me the app takes time to update the latest trips i decided to wait for the update with him 10 he then told me that if i was getting late i could get off now and not make any payment and when his app updates he will send me the screenshot and i can pay him i told him i could wait as i did not have work today and had all the time in the world 11 he then said okay but he will have to circle around the airport and cannot wait at the departure gate 12 i told him i was fine with that and i was willing to wait for hours too if needed 13 while driving around and waiting for the app to update i tried calling uber customer care no answer i tried seeing my old rides i tried checking his old rides etc he kept telling me to be patient and it will update my ride history did show his ride but it was just his details i could not complain i could not report or anything it was just the name of the driver there was no ride started or canceled written or anything which i admit was weird 14 i told him that i have experienced this in bangalore before and i know what he is doing and i am not going to let go of this 15 this is when he tried getting aggressive and started talking in marathi saying this is mumbai the rules are different here 16 i replied in marathi which flustered him because he realized now he could not play the language card either 17 we kept roaming around the airport for 15 minutes waiting for the update he realized that this was a losing game and again asked me to get off and make the payment when the app updates in my app and his app 18 this struck me very late third mistake but i realized that i could have just asked him to drive to the uber counter at the airport and get this sorted when i suggested this he said he could not go there because of some clearly made up rule i told him there was nothing like this and let us just go there 19 this is when he finally gave up and started begging me to get out of the cab and said that he did not take any money from me so why am i wasting his time and that he is losing fares etc i told him i was willing to pay the 475 rupees as long as there was proof and i did not want to swindle him off his hard earned money he started folding his hands and all and kept requesting that i get off i felt bad for him fourth mistake 20 finally i let him off fifth mistake and exited the cab when he drove off i forgot to take a picture of the car my last mistake 21 after that i asked around and managed to find the uber counter and asked them to make a complaint about this guy 22 they too were puzzled how this guy managed to game the system because while his ride was shown in my ride history there was no way to report him i could report the other drivers but not him but they confirmed that if i was auto assigned another driver that only happens when the driver does not start the trip and cancels it after a while 23 the uber fellows just took a picture of the guy s account from my app and told me that they will follow up which i know they will not tldr some uber fellow tried to scam me by not starting the ride which was completely my fault and showing me some screenshots of some inflated payment and when he was caught he tried to weasel his way out i did not pay him anything so no harm was done to me but do not make the same mistakes i did always confirm the ride has started i usually do this but because my aunt was very nervous my attention was diverted also as usual uber helplines are useless",
