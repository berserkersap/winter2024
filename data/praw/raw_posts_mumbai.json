So please if you know of any small time tech job specialising in data science (SQL, pandas, r and all that jazz), web dev, etc lemme know. This doesn't even have to be a proper internship lmao I just want something with minimal pay to fuel my actual hobbies. This can be YOU THE DEAR READER with a huge workload and perhaps would love a kinda assistant to do some of your work for you and in return would pay him with pennies(negotiable hopefully) almost like slavery but with extra steps ifykyk.

I want to explore the city, but I’m often held back by this anxiety—what if someone I know sees me alone and thinks I’m a loser or loner?\n\nI enjoy movies, music, and occasionally go clubbing when it’s an office event, but I’d like to do more. I’ve been considering solo activities like:\n\nJoining a dance class (to have fun and meet people)\n\nExploring cool spots around the city (cafes, galleries, etc.)\n\nTaking photos for my Instagram (which currently has 0 posts—LoL).\n\n\nHow do I overcome the fear of being judged for doing things alone? Any suggestions for fun activities to try solo or ways to build a social life from scratch?\n",

I used to be an extroverted and outgoing person as a child, but my parents started controlling my life, and I ended up spending many years in social isolation. This has made it really hard for me to connect with others and talk to people.\n\nNow, because of my poor social skills, I find it difficult to work and interact with others. My mind often goes blank when someone talks to me, and it takes me so much time to process what other person is saying. I feel slow and don’t know what to say, so most of the time I stay quiet. I worry that I’ll say something stupid or dumb. I feel like I’m a burden to others because of my disability and lack of social skills, which makes me afraid of talking to people. I don’t start conversations because I’m scared of coming across as annoying, and I wait for others to talk to me instead.\n\nI am not useful to others, I don’t have interesting life experiences to share. I don’t know how to keep a conversation going. My friends are extroverts, but I don’t really enjoy talking to them or anyone else. I don’t know when to start or stop talking, and I feel like I’m just a burden. I struggle to understand how others manage to connect with each other so naturally. I constantly force myself to socialize, but I don’t enjoy it. \n\nHow do you socialize with people and friends in your day-to-day life? Why do you enjoy socializing? How can I improve my social skills, and how can I stop feeling like a burden in social situations? What steps can I take to become more comfortable with socializing and connect with others in a meaningful way?\n\nI really want to improve and stop feeling isolated, but I’m not sure how to take the first step.

        "post": "When I moved to Mumbai in 2019, I came from the serene hills, where life was slow, peaceful, and predictable. To say I didn’t like Mumbai would be an understatement. The traffic was maddening, the pollution overwhelming, and the crowds suffocating. The small houses and lack of open spaces made me feel like I’d never find my place here.\n\nBut today, as I look back, I realize how much Mumbai has changed me—and for the better. There’s something about this city that makes you come alive. The hustle here is infectious. Everyone is doing something. Whether it’s a corporate executive juggling meetings or a homemaker running a small business from her kitchen, Mumbai embodies the spirit of “never stop.”\n\nWhat struck me most was how even people from privileged backgrounds are driven by the need to create, to contribute, to hustle—not necessarily for the money, but because they want to do something. That energy inspires you. It forces you to find your purpose, to push yourself, and to keep going even when life gets tough.\n\nMumbai has taught me resilience, gratitude, and ambition. There’s a saying I once heard from a taxi driver here: “Mumbai has a vardaan (blessing). If you work hard, this city will always give you what you need. But if you leave, the wealth stays behind.” I didn’t fully understand it back then, but now I do. Mumbai rewards effort, passion, and perseverance.\n\nThis post isn’t just about how I fell in love with Mumbai; it’s about how this city transformed me. It taught me to thrive in chaos, to embrace challenges, and to keep hustling, no matter what.\n\nToday, I can’t imagine living anywhere else. Mumbai is tough, but it’s also generous. And for that, I’ll always be grateful.\n\nTo anyone who’s ever doubted this city or struggled to adjust here—give it time. Let Mumbai work its magic on you. You might just find yourself falling in love, just like I did.\n\nPS : it’s my first post on Reditt not sure if it’s the right way to post :) ",

It developed some sliding issue.\n\n\nI raised the first request a month ago, a service boy (Ramjan) came took a week to come to my home only to tell me that this product needs a replacement, He told he would raise the support ticket for the same. He did nothing after that, my request got closed by the furlenco team. Then I kept on raising new requests after that to get it fixed. I have been doing this like every 2nd day. Finally a person (Sandesh Bandal) called few days back and I explained him the issue. Sandesh told me he will send  service boy again. Today that service boy came. It was Ramjan again. I asked him why he didn't do anything previous time, he said he thought it would have been done by now (Basically he didn't raise any support last time). So I told him not to leave before escalating the issue this time. [I didn't let him leave for like an hour or so]. He called his seniors (Bansi) to explain that the product needs to be replaced. Bansi told Ramdan that he doesn't know what to do and asked Ramdan to tell me that \"we at service team can't help with replacement\". So I told them to escalate this issue to replacement team. Bansi told me he would do that right away.  He disconnected the call and basically flew.\n\n\n\nNow Ramdan couldn't leave unless Bansi reverts. Ramdan kept on calling people from his team and they told him Bansi is not washroom, meeting room etc. etc. we waited for 30 mins for Bansi to return. Bansi told me he was trying to reach people in Bangalore and they are not picking his call. \nSo I pressurized them to send me a screenshot of the mail they sent to the replacement team. They had no response to this. They started fooling around. Bansi told me there is no mailing channel within the team and communication happens over phone only and they are unable to contact the bangalore team. He ensured that he will get the replacement done at any cost and let Ramdan leave. So Ramdan left and I still awaiting a response from Bansi and Ramdan.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile I had created a new support ticket earlier this morning about the issue, so again got contacted in evening today by a support agent himaacharya. I explained her everything above and told her I am still waiting for response from Bansi and Ramdan. She was so rude, she disconnected my call since she couldn't help me with the issue (like really?). Lol, when has it ever happened to someone that they got hung up on be the customer-care. Who the hell are these people hiring and what kind of customer service is this company offering. They don't value their customers, their time.\n\n\n\n",

        "post": "\n\nHey, this is probably my first ever post on Reddit. I'm a 26 year old man who has recently moved to Mumbai. I was working in Bangalore before this, and I shifted to Mumbai because of a new job. I've come to Mumbai before - and everytime I came here, the city won me over. I found the city to be beautifully chaotic, and loved the hustle, the professionalism, and the economic/social duality of the city. Everytime I used to visit Mumbai, I thought to myself that I'll shift here someday. I believed the city had a lot to offer, and I still do.\n\nBut here I am - I moved in here a couple of months back, and it hasn't been as easy and eventful as I thought it'd be. I've felt lonely here on most days, and even though the people here are extremely hospitable and helpful, I just feel very alone amongst the bustling crowds. The hustle and the non forgiving nature of the city is making me feel extremely overwhelmed. I don't have people to chill with here, I don't know what to do in my free time here (which is very little fml), and I don't know what I should do to feel a bit more stable. \n\nI've lived away from home since I was 18. I've lived in multiple cities, and have ended up finding my feet in each city. I know how to live alone, I even cherish it. I know it'll happen in Mumbai too, but sometimes the city scares me. There's something in Mumbai that makes me feel that I'll never be able to settle down here, that I'll always feel lonely here, and that it's always going to be as overwhelming as it is right now. \n\nI don't know what to do, who to hang out with, or where to go. I miss the life I had in Bangalore, and I've been going out of my comfort zone everyday to get sense of the city and to talk to new people, but it's just not feeling right. Was hoping I'd come on Reddit and ask the gang here to give me a few tips on how to be at peace make it big at the same time in the city of dreams \n",

In a blinking of an eye he changed the Rs 500.note to Rs 100. Wow! I asked him calmly, he said I gave him Rs 100 only. Since I was getting late for the exam I just walked away . Lesson learnt. Stay away from any random dubious taxi in airport. Always ask if upi is there first. Has anyone experienced this? How did you resolve this? New to Mumbai. How do I stay away from people who are trying to scam you left and right?",

        "post": "I’m absolutely disgusted. I bought 2 pack of brownies from Ditch The Guilt (+ a few other products). When I opened the pack, I found **fungus** all over one of the brownies. (Check the photo.) This isn’t just a little mold – it’s legit fungus growing on it.  And no, it isn’t chocolate bloom, it smells rotten and shitty.\n\nI immediately contacted the brand **multiple times**—email, WhatsApp, even tried calling—and guess what? **No reply. No nothing.** They’re just ignoring me like this is no big deal. (It’s been 14 days)\n\nBut here’s the worst part: my little sister ate a piece of these brownies before I saw what was on them, and before she spit it, and she’s was feeling sick ever since. It was nothing major, just stomach cramps (might be placebo because just took a bite) but my anxiety was acting up (she is good now). But this has scared me. This is beyond irresponsible.  \n\nHow can a company sell food like this and then act like nothing happened when someone complains? **I’m beyond frustrated.** They clearly don’t care about customer safety, and they definitely don’t care about their responsibility when it comes to quality control.  \n\nAnd mind you, I didn’t even care about refund, it’s just 80rs each. I wanted to inform them about this but they didn’t even bother to check or ask me batch codes or anything so nobody else gets it.\n\nI’m posting this because people need to know. If you’re thinking of buying from this brand, **DON’T**. Their products are disgusting, and they have zero respect for their customers.  \n\nAlso, here’s https://youtube.com/shorts/8uU6Q4VKgqI?si=86MKS55hLW9heWql a video of how they are a fraud and making false claims on the protein.\n\nI was stupid to throw the stuff, I am buying again and getting them all products tested.

A private tour will be cheaper and have a pre-approved itinerary but I don’t think any flexibility. \n\nWhat are your votes? We will not stay at the airport.

These 3 months have been hell moving into this new place which seems like a nightmare that one should never face. The house condition has deteriorated within 3 months due to leakages and plumbing issues which the owner doesn’t reply to after multiple emails. The owner sufficiently ignores all the queries asked or help needed to fix the house as the living condition of this house is unbearable. \n\nAnd today he sent us a draft of 8 pager with jargon and showing us in bad light how we have broken promises and didn’t do the needful which is funny because everything has been paid on time on or before the agreed date of 5th. The fines are as follows\n\n- Electricity bill 3 months + days of non payment(5k/pd)+ 36% interest on dues \n\n- Internet plan charges( which we wanted upgrade and had mailed 3 times but never got a reply) \n\n- Legally enforceable warning notice charges(clause 12.6) -10k \n\nThe above mentioned electricity bill and wifi bill had been paid on or before 5th as per the bills received from the tenant. \n\nAdditionally he has mentioned Double LF & Notice period for breach during lockin amounting to -19,50,000\n\nNeed this subs help to guide through and how to fight this because this is just harassment to aide money in 3 months of time of just moving in.

Just like everyone else, I look forward to the end of the year so the city can actually be enjoyed and one can feel light breathing in cool clean air. I hope it still happens. Anyway, here are some images from a while ago that we can reminisce.   \n\nAbout a year ago, my ceiling collapse in my apartment. The civil work that followed forced me to reluctantly move into my parents house. I have always been a mild alcoholic and wasn’t in the best shape of my life so I decided to utilize the circumstances to excercise both my physical and mental faculties. \n\nOne of the routines I concocted was to wake up a little before dawn and anticipate the Mumbai sky. It was just the middle of winter and on some mornings the sky was full of wonder. I woke up to colors I had forgotten that the city sky was able to conjure. Deep pinks. Mediterranean oranges. Grape fruit purples. \n\nSometimes the morning smog veiled the buildings and brought about an eerie silence. Often the smog blocked out the sunrise leading to a display of diffuse and muddy colors. I suppose even pollution could be beautiful if we knew how to look. \n\nI have some 4 months worth of these photographs, taken more or less from the same spot on my parents balcony, and around the same time daily for the time I was with them. The city and its sky gradually got less photogenic as summer came along and winter faded. I wondered what I would do with all these photos. I suppose I took them so they could be shared. ",

I will be travelling with my partner from Pune to Mumbai and we will have 2 suitcases and 2 cabin bags. We are flying to Vietnam for a month using VietJet.\n\nVietJet is known to prepone flights or delay flights. For this reason, we thought of reaching Mumbai in the morning itself, spend some time in the city and then head to the Airport by 8 PM. The other option is to directly reach the Airport at 8 PM and not stay in Mumbai; however, like I said, VietJet is notorious for preponing or postponing flights. In such a situation, it is better to have a hotel in the morning and be in Mumbai and keep monitoring any changes in flight updates.\n\nKeeping this in mind, what are some areas around the Airport where I can get hotels in 3k which are safe? I don't mind being 5kms away from the Airport as I'll be getting there in the morning itself. I will have enough time to catch my flight at 1 am. I tried to search [booking.com](http://booking.com) and airbnb but could not find anything that would be safe to stay with my partner and all the luggage.\n\nOr should I just ditch the idea of booking a hotel and reach the Airport early by 6 PM?

The ones I encountered on the holiday were worse. Turns out there are types. And our body sort of gets used to local suckers. But suckers you meet on a holiday are different and give you bigger boils.\n\n\n\nI have been back from my trip 3 days ago. Still itching from the bites I got on my trip. And for the 5 days I was away, I thought the resident suckers in my house would be dead by now. And since the house is fully closed, no new ones would enter.\n\n\n\nBut that was not to be. On my first night back home in Mumbai..... there they were. Sucking away. Sleep quality destroyed.\n\n\n\nToday morning was the worst. More like last night. Around 3 am, I had to fully cocoon myself in my blanket. Not even an opening to breath. I figured breathing can be managed somehow. Let my skin get some rest first. \n\n\n\nBut one of the suckers must have made it INTO my blanket before I sealed it shut. At some point, I felt breathless and had to inhale a large volume of air through my mouth. And I immediately swallowed the sucker who infiltrated my blanket.\n\n\n\nSo now I had a mosquito stuck in my throat. I had to drink some water. And so.... out my blanket I had to emerge once again. Sleep ruined. Wide awake. Life in tatters.\n\n\n\nHow are you guys contending with mosquitos in Mumbai? The warm temperature isn't helping. Every inch of roads being dug up isn't helping. Literal garbage piles down every street aren't helping. Open gutters aren't helping.\n\n\n\nHow am I living the life of a medieval peasant in 2024, in \"India's financial capital\"??",

        "post": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m a 26-year-old researcher earning ₹30k per month. Recently, my work took me to Gwalior for a conference. I booked a train ticket in the 1AC compartment, but it got upgraded to a private cabin. There, I shared the space with a navy officer (around 32 years old) and two other women (unrelated to him).\n\nI was busy working on my laptop, but the group was friendly and started a conversation. They asked about my work, and I explained what I do. I’ve always been taught not to trust anyone since I moved out at 18. I’ve strictly adhered to this principle… until this journey.\n\nMy father is a huge admirer of the Indian defense forces, and his respect for them has deeply influenced me. I have always held immense regard for the armed forces, and perhaps that softened my usual guard.\n\nAs the night progressed, the officer began sharing fascinating aspects of his life in the navy. He showed me pictures of ships, weapons, and military practices, explaining how critical confidentiality is in his line of work. I felt honored when he said, \"You're like my little brother, so I trust you.\"\n\nThe next morning, he approached me, visibly worried, and asked for ₹6,000. He said his PhonePe wasn’t working and offered a cheque in return. At first, I hesitated—after all, trusting strangers isn’t in my nature. But he reassured me, flashing his navy badge and emphasizing that someone in his position couldn’t cheat anyone. He even shared his Aadhar and PAN card details and promised to repay me within 2–3 days. Against my better judgment, I gave him the money.\n\nWhen I deposited the cheque after coming back to Mumbai after 2-3 days, I was told it bounced due to insufficient funds. That’s when reality struck. It’s been a month now, and despite my repeated reminders, he keeps making excuses—salary delays, technical issues, and so on. He promised to repay me by December 1, but today is December 5, and I haven’t received a single rupee.\n\nI feel utterly betrayed. I never trusted anyone in my life, but this time, my respect for the armed forces led me to let my guard down, and I was scammed. I haven’t told my family yet, especially since we have a lawyer in the family, but I feel ashamed to admit my naivety.\n\nI still want my money back and have all his details: his phone number, Aadhar card, PAN card, and the bounced cheque. I don’t know what to do next. Please guide me.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nA navy officer I met on a train asked for ₹6,000, claiming his PhonePe wasn’t working and offering a cheque in return. I trusted him due to my respect for the armed forces and gave him the money. The cheque bounced, and he’s been giving excuses for a month. I feel scammed but have his details. How can I recover my money?\n\n",

The flat was taken through a broker, who had promised it would be deep cleaned after the previous tenants vacated. However, despite multiple reminders, the broker never arranged for the cleaning. Ultimately, I had to get the flat professionally deep cleaned myself (I have proof of the booking).\n\nThroughout my stay, the broker and landlord were unhelpful—they refused to cover any repairs and abruptly increased the rent by 14% at the start of the third year, threatening eviction if we didn’t comply. Now that I am vacating the flat, the landlord has deducted a portion of the deposit for deep cleaning and painting, despite the fact that I left the flat in much better condition than I received it (I have video evidence of the flat's condition).\n\nHaving lived in Mumbai for 8 years across three rented flats, I’ve never faced such an issue with any other landlord. What can I do to recover my money? Is it possible to press charges?",

And very far but Thane is not bad tho . \n\nOnly thing is like its development had stopped in my opinion, same old wala viviana mall and no new places to explore . \n\nN of u live especially in Hiranandani estate, the local station is bloody 10!km . \n\nBut its still liveable.

They want you to attend every lecture but don't know how to teach. They will make you sit in lab for 2 hrs everyday but won't teach you anything. The HOD is also uncooperative as we asked her to let us study for placements as we were not gaining in lectures anything anyways but, being the bitch she is, she won't allow that too. If you want to do MCA in VJTI just don't. I am telling you that it's the biggest regret of my life. The department is also neglected in the college. This college just cares about Btech and nothing else. Fuck this college. If I take a leap and do suicide then it will all be on VJTI. This fucking college should just let us do studies for placements or atleast mould the syllabus in a way that it helps us get jobs but no, why would they do that. They just want to see you suffer.

There was this uncle in his mid-60s, giving off a really creepy vibe. He was wearing a mask and carrying an umbrella for some reason. I was standing in the queue, and he was right beside me. At first, he was trying to touch me with his umbrella inappropriately. I ignored him at first, thinking it might have been a mistake, and carried on with my own business. After more attempts from him, I was sure that something wasn't right, so I turned my back to him and tried to ignore him. When he finally got off the train, I felt a huge sense of relief.\n\nI hope no one experiences the same. It still makes me think, is the local train safe for people like me?\nI was shocked this happened in a first class compartment.\n",

        "post": "\nHi Reddit,  \n\nI’m an 18-year-old male from Mumbai, currently preparing for competitive exams. Over the past few months, I’ve been struggling with:  \n\n- Phone addiction (wasting hours scrolling aimlessly).  \n- Food addiction (turning to binge-eating for comfort).  \n- Procrastination and difficulty staying focused on studies.  \n- General feelings of stress, low motivation, and mild depression.  \n\nI’ve tried online resources like Dr. K’s videos and other self-help materials, which have been helpful to an extent, but I feel that working one-on-one with a professional would make a bigger difference for me.  \n\nI'm quite aware of some patterns and emotional patterns and other addictive patterns but can't help myself. \n\nI’m looking for a psychotherapist or coach who:  \n1. Is affordable (I’m a student with limited financial resources).  \n2. Is results-oriented—someone who can guide me with practical, actionable advice.  \n3. Is direct but compassionate—a no-nonsense approach, but still understanding.  \n4. Is based in Mumbai (for in-person help) or available online.  \n\nIf you know someone who fits this description or have personally benefited from someone, I’d be really grateful for your recommendation. I’m serious about overcoming these challenges and improving myself but need the right support to move forward.  \n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this and for any help you can offer!  \n\n---  \nP.S. Please avoid generic suggestions or motivational resources—I’m looking for professional, structured guidance.",

But I'd like to know opinions on what should be one's total expenditure (including virtuallly every expense) in a city like Mumbai. (Preferably as a percentage of income (my post-tax income is about 50lpa). Researched this as far as I could find on the net, it only says 50/30/20 which I'm sure won't apply to my bracket. (Ps. I do not mean unnecessary spending on luxury items but more so towards lifestyle improvements like better stay/locality/gyms/sports facilities that sort of things)\n\nThanks a lot in advance fellow redditors!!

        "post": "My bestfriend is getting married soon. Wedding functions and festivities have started. He has been my bestfriend since childhood. And now he has not even invited me to his wedding festivities, only for wedding and that also because he needs another car in case of need for baarat and relatives. His other friends were invited and are invited in all functions big or small. I met him a couple of days back and he didn't even mention any of the functions happening. \nWe have been bestfriends since 20years plus. And I don't even know how to comprehend this. I feel betrayed and hurt. \nGot hurt by a friend, i never expected.\n\nEdit. UPDATE!!!\n\nI attended the wedding. \nI was the first friend to reach to his place, helped with all the arrangements, did pick-ups for all his relatives, looked after him. He asked me to bring my car, bcs I didn't take it. I brought my car then, though conflicted... Took him, another friend of his and his brothers, went to Venue 1. Helped him out over there, as he had a very long photoshoot there... I was completely occupied with coordination, arrangements, providing locations, other things through the whole time. His group of friends turned up quite later, I was juggling everything being the point of contact with Event Mgmt, bride's family, grooms family and plenty of other guests and friends. The friends were there only for Instagramable photos and videos of them, the groom and them and the bride and them.\n\nWe were late for the baarat, rushed him, looked after all his valuables and stuff needed for the wedding ceremonies. Reached almost in time for Baarat. \nLet me tell you, Baarat was dull AF. I quite literally was feeling so bad... There was no energy, no excitement. I jumped in with all energy to bring the vibe, pulled his cousins, older relatives, friends and danced like anything. It was so good to see him Happy. He smiled the first time through the whole day till then. I was by his side from the early morning. All the ceremonies for entry and other things happened. Then there was the dream romantic moment \" Varmala \".\n\nWe head inside to proceed with other ceremony and pooja. I was handling multiple things, catering, maharaj, seating, event mgmt, valuables, gifts, etc. The couple was drained bcs of the heat and constant ceremonies without any break. They requested for refreshments multiple times to the group of friends who were with them when they were seated for the ceremonies, while I was running to get people, parents, uncle aunties needed for Poojas and handling catering to get it ready for lunch as guests started to flow in. The couple's need wasn't even heard by this group. When I came to them to update on certain things, they were literally looking half dead snd and were like kuch bhi leke aa khane please. I was so angry at that point, ki kya chutiye log hai ( their friends), couldn't they just signal a waiter and ask for refreshments. I arranged for a full time waitress near the bride, made 4 people guard 2 access paths to the couple as people were walking and standing in between and blocking their view and disrupting flow of people's movement. \nThen comes the joota churai and pheras, I was his anwar and was right with him all the time. Made him and bride laugh, we got great pictures. The pheras was a Bang! So much fun, enjoyed so much, we were actually dancing between the pheras, as the bride had selected a playlist to play specifically and the families were performing. There was a moment after phera, where I almost was caught in cross fire by multiple cousins of the bride who tried to steal the joota from me😂. They failed. I was dragging 7 people... Kinda felt like Sunny Deol from Gaddar when I saw the actual video of this incident 😂. The group of friends of his and the bride were completely occupied with their immature jokes and gossips about concerts. They were least bit attentive to the needs of the couple and the festivities. They were just buzzing like PAPS on specific moments to capture the moment and then back to discussing about captions, filters, etc to post on Instagram.\nThey left after the pheras and didn't even stay till the Bidai. I felt terrible. What's this???!!! Who does this? You don't expect this from your \" close friends\". I was then again occupied with other errands like getting older people and other guests to groom's home, station or hotels. Getting dining setup for the big family dinner, bringing in gifts, etc.\nI stuck around, helped with packing, loading stuff back into the cars, surprisingly he noticed I wasn't there at the dining table, so he called me to join his family for dinner. I had a hilarious moment at the dining table. I was served a piece of sandwich and right then at that instant comes the cameraman putting his camera into my face and i started laughing 😂😂😂 I told, Bhai meme baneyga kya mera? Dost ki shadi me dost sandwich me concentrate kar raha hai😂😂😂. P.S. We didn't get to eat anything except a few starters from 8am till 7pm. \nTook the bride and the groom and his parents in my car to his place. Again took all the stuff from multiple cars up to his home, sorted them out again. Informed everything to his parents. Then there were some pooja to be done to welcome the bride to her newly wedded home. Sat finally, had small talks with his relatives. The best part of the day, was when his Grandparents thanked me and gave me their blessings for being there the whole day and helping them. His parents and relatives also acknowledged that and asked me about our friendship, like are you college friend or school friends, they were surprised that we are friends over 20 years. Then he called me to his room, to sit with him and the bride, we were just chilling and having fun, gossiping about some weird stuff at the wedding and they were teasing me ki Agla number tera hai, koi pasand aayi kya aaj, etc etc.\nI told him, I will take your leave now... By then I was with him over 14 hours, that's when he hugged me and thanked me. I was happy for him. And I was happy that I did go and didn't miss out on his special day. His thanks was not what I was working for, but that was a moment, an indication of respect and value for this friendship. \nI loved doing every bit of things I did today in his wedding. I didn't do for his appreciation or respect. I had a duty \"Farz\" as a brother, I hope i did justice to it...\nHe is a married man now. I just hope to see him regularly and wish him a happy and healthy married life.",

They really thought the exit plan well to keep the venue and counters open well after the concert. We hung back to have some food and drinks to avoid traffic on the way back. The stage was well managed and the acoustics were also on-point. Maroon 5 was brilliant and Adam Levine was an amazing performer on the night. I flew in from Delhi for the concert and wished it didn’t end so soon. Almost everyone I know really enjoyed the concert, which set a new benchmark for concerts in India for me personally. The only downside: hangers-on who were there just to record videos for social media and didn’t know the band’s many many hits. ",

Ola offers this fancy deal.\nI booked an Ola under their promotion discount at 380 as it was the budget option compared to the others...and they charged me 540 as the final fare on the drivers application. When I checked my Trip History it shows this convenient new invoice of Rs. 515\n\n1. Ola had quoted me 380 exact upon booking the ride, not a price range of 380-540 etc. If you're quoting an exact price, how can they make a price change at the end of the ride of a big amount such as 160 rs.\n\n2. I did not change any distance whilst comparing. This amount was quoted to me including Sea Link in the fare total. \n\n3. I have frequently travelled via Uber and Rapido over sealink during my exams only as I want to study and not have a distraction/botheration. Uber/Rapido has not charged me for toll fare, or they usually include it at the beginning itself. \n\n4. Checked on Google whether I'm liable to pay tolls inter City, and Ola itself promotes that it's included in the cab fare\n\n5. Their helpline service interface is so trash,it has such an inconvenient model and I cannot even raise my query. It forces you to select Voucher.\nFor compensation they are giving me a voucher which I don't wish to use. If you are overcharging me for your service you should simply refund it to my bank account. \n\nWhen I select i am not satisfied with my resolution, it changes absolutely nothing and they ask me to raise new issues.\n\n6. The voucher is worthless to me. It's as useful as the swiggy coupons with which they give a discount of 100 rs and then immediately add the same as hidden costs such as Packing charges... \nTheir promotion is the only reason why I booked the cab, the pricing they offered is the only reason why I was convinced to go ahead with them. Never making the same mistake again. \n\n7. Online helpline number from Google is a deadend/invalid. The rest of the numbers are for hiring purposes.\n\n",

He took it as an invitation to start conversing with me, he's like \" seriously, kisi see ladke ko bra pehente hue nahi dekha?\" . I was like Nope.\n\nThen he goes, \"My friends wear it too\", I was like \"Coool\" , Then I was sure ki this is one of them youtube pranks so I asked him \"Where's the camera? Is this like a prank?\" He said No, I looked around i couldn't spot one fr. \n\nHe then starts showing the bra off to me, offers me to touch it to see how it feels, then the in the most horrifying moment he opened it and showed me his nipple.\n\nI was TRAUMATISED!! \n\nThis guy then is like, my friends suck on it and i suck theirs. \n\nI wanted to either kill myself or end this topic but I was waiting and couldn't move it was peak time I didn't wanna miss the train coming. So i switch the topic and ask him where he is going, he says Jogeshwari, I told him this one is a fast train, it wont stop and he wont be able to get off at Andheri because of the office 5PM crowd. \n\nHe sincerely asked what train he should take from what platform - I said upar jao and check on the screens where its 12B slow or even 12V slow. \n\nand just like that as he came \n\nHe Left\n\n  \nI don't know what just happened to me, just wanted to share it somewhere before I forget about it.

The flight involves change of planes with a long layover in Dubai. I've a valid US B1/B2 visa. I've checked online, Indian citizens with a valid US visa can get a visa on arrival in Dubai. The journey only involves change of planes and no change in terminal. I've the following doubts:-\n\n1) Do I need visa on arrival for this particular situation?\n\n2) What about luggage? Do I need to check in again?\n\nThis is my first time in such a situation, so I'm a bit confused. I'd be thankful if fellow travelers can guide me if they have any idea about this scenario. ",

        "post": "My life has been absolutely mired down, thanks to a myriad problems gulping me down like quicksand. I stood out as a prodigy as a child, playing several musical instruments, verbalising sublime expressions of the mind, memorising large pieces of texts and scriptural chants and acing all academics, especially Science and Math (solving calculus at blazing speed); my work recognised by even Cambridge and Microsoft. Everyone who knew me, including myself believed I'd make something substantial out of this potential. My goals and dreams spanned across continents, imagining myself tossing my graduation hat on a foreign soil. \n\nIt's all ruined. My trauma and abuse took all of it away. I've lost my personality, my piercing intellect and whatever I used to be, it's no worse than getting lobotomized. It's like being the same being but in a different mind, a dumb one, that coupled with an extremely toxic family is strangulating me. I've visited multiple docs, from psych to neuros, popping SSRIs everyday, but nothing works. I've ruled out all logical possibilities of me getting better; wouldn't it be better if I let go of this body now, than living a crippled life, stripped of my identity and true potential rather than living like an anhedonic zombie?\n\nMy family, acting completely oblivious to my suffering is pushing me to work, and I too think making a few bucks before I depart would be of great help for them as well as for my last rites. Leaving my great ambitions I once held, and swallowing all my pride like poison, I'm desperately seeking a job in IT (since I majored it) to aid my family's precarious financial condition. I'll literally work for a few thousand rupees or even free if you're take care of my travelling expenses, willing to work anywhere in Mumbai/Navi-Mumbai.\n\nAlso, I've said this in my previous post and I shall repeat that don't try to convince to act otherwise. A life of mediocrity and struggle doesn't seem enticing enough to live for against the eternal peace awaiting on the other side. Any leads would be appreciated. \n\nEdit 1: Do checkout my previous post for better context, so you understand what I'm stuck in rn. I'm 21 M for people who're asking.\n\nEdit 2: I'm not autistic, and highly extroverted. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/s/uaIZt05W9G",

I can bear calling people younger than me as \"sir\". Not a big deal at all. Savings is the goal.\n\n- Be away for 6 months from family, but also be with them 24/7 for months 24/7. My wife's family & in-laws will be there for her.\n\n- Save easily to retire at 55-60 with peace. The target savings figure would be different for everyone. For me it's equivalent of at least USD 250K in today's date.\n\nPlease advise. Also open to advice regarding other careers to achieve this savings goal. \n\nP.S, not interested in stocks & crypto please.",

        "title": "AJIO is horrible and exploits both customers and delivery agents. ",
        "post": "Background:\n\nDuring the 2024 Black Friday sale, I ordered a pair of Aldo shoes for 7.7K after all coupons (MRP: 17K). I also applied a card discount to get the final billing down to 6.5K. Since no other platform could match this price, I ordered it from Ajio itself. \n\nOn 30th November (Saturday), the product came. They had sent me a wrong shoe. I had ordered a Cognac Moccasin but they sent a Rum Derby. I instantly placed an exchange request, however since the product was different from what I ordered, they forced me to start a return. \n\nNo issue tbh, I just went ahead and ordered a new pair as the price was still the same. \n\nThe Main Issue: \n\nFast forward to 3rd December, I got my second delivery and yet again it was a wrong shoe. Same as before, it was a Rum Derby. Again, I got in touch with support and they said the only course of action is to return the product.\n\n Since my initial return was still 'under review', this time I generated a return saying product quality not adequate. I did not want to wait another week for my money back. I called customer care once again after placing this return and they said that the return is incorrect and the courier will not accept the shoes. Then they went ahead and cancelled my return request but said it will take 2 days for the return cancellation to reflect, post which I can place another return. \n\nAt 4 Pm, to my surprise, the courier guy comes to collect the shoe and I hand it over. He takes the photos and I get a message saying the return is complete and refund is being processed. A few hours later, the courier shows up again saying that this return was rejected at our HQ (He is from Delhivery) and now I will have to take back the shoes and pay him the amount as the courier company is going to charge him for the error. \n\nSeeing this, I got in touch with Ajio and said this is an honest mistake, what can be done. Ajio said and I quote \"Sir please don't worry, you sit back and relax. ignore the courier guy. It is their mistake to accept the shoes and it is not your fault. If he comes again, please send him away or call us\". \n\nI mean, firstly it is Ajio's fault for sending wrong shoes. Then another blunder on their behalf is not having prompt processes to cancel pickups. If a pickup request is completed in 2 hours, the cancellation of the same should be done in a few minutes tops. \n\nComing to the rubbish return processes. The courier  being a poor man has no idea about moccasins or derby shoes. He also clicked all required photos and sent the shoes back to Ajio. Why the fuck did Ajio initiate a return without checking the shoe themselves. By giving shifting both duty and blame to a third party, they cant simply absolve themselves of wrong doing. This is their fault just as much as the courier if not more. \n\nAfter all this, either me or the poor delivery man will be out of pocket by approximately 6500. I belong to a well off family and will not let him suffer. But others may not be able to or willing to shell out for someone else's mistake. \n\nAjio's platform may be user friendly, cheap and good enough for most. However the company as a whole has horrible processes and I request you to not use their services. They plain as day exploit their workers and customers. ",

But the Transwoman kept asking us “kyun nahi dega? De na. Kyun nahi?”. So after rejecting her several times, I said, ”go get a job if you want money”.\n\nShe got angry and cursed me for a bad life. But I don’t know if I should take that seriously. \n\nNow I know it’s not easy for them to find a job, but come on this is Mumbai, a very accepting city. There must be ways to earn than just begging.\n\nDid I wrong her?\n\n\n\n",

But I didn't know about Dabeli (although it's a Gujarati food) and the first time I tried it, it tasted was super awesome. I mean, it's far better than Vada pav. So, there are both Dabeli shop as well as Vada pav shop near my office. Whenever we go for there for a snack, almost all of us prefer Dabeli over Vada pav any day.

I can speak Hindi fluently (without an accent), have studied and have theatre/acting experience. I can manage the Indian accent on English as well, haha. Pretty in touch with North Indian culture (that’s where my family is from). I have finished my Bachelors degree and got accepted into medical school in the US, but pushed my acceptance a year (deferral) to do this. Might add another year or change plans based off of my experience (more below). Being an actress, and especially in Bollywood has been my dream career since I was a kid. I thought that focusing on a “real” career like becoming a doctor would make me forget that, but as I get closer to the next step, I know it would be my biggest regret in life if I didn’t give it my all at least once. \n\nI’m coming on an OCI card, so legalities shouldn’t be an issue. All of my family is in other parts of India, and don’t really have much connection to Mumbai. I thought the easiest way would be to find a shared flat in Andheri West. I’m planning to stay for at least a year, and experience, and shape future plans based off of what I feel. \n\nHere are some of my plans:\n- Find roommate on Facebook for an only-girls flat. Only thing is, I don’t know if telling them my honest backstory is safe or if I should make up something based off of family that lives in Delhi. \n- I have a good amount of savings but still think I should have some sort of income/job to help myself out\n- I think I may have an internship at a major casting company, any tips from anyone who has gone through that route?\n- Objectively, I think I’m good looking for roles (this is in case one of the tips is, “be good looking” 😂)\n- Any fellow actors – what tips you got for managing and finding opportunities in this digital audition world? Networking?\n- Getting around and traveling in that Andheri area, which is the best value and safest mode of transportation you use?\n\nMy post is super barebones but I can answer questions to your responses below. If fellow actors and those who reside around Andheri West could give me some good tips to set myself up there, it would be greatly appreciated 🙏🏼 ",

        "post": "Four years ago, I purchased a 1BHK apartment in Kandivali from Ruparel Realty, a reputed builder known for projects in South Bombay. Unfortunately, the timing of my purchase—just two months before the pandemic—has turned into a nightmare. The construction timeline was severely delayed due to the pandemic, and since then, the builder has been pushing the possession date month by month with no concrete resolution. Now, I’ve been informed that the possession is expected by 31st December 2025, but there’s no guarantee this deadline will be met. Meanwhile, I’ve been paying bank interest on the loan for the last four years without any benefit in return. I am now torn between three options: selling the property at whatever price I can get, waiting another year in the hope of finally receiving possession, or taking legal action against the builder to address these delays. I am seeking advice on the best course of action to minimize my financial and emotional stress.",

        "title": "Incident with Uber driver.",
        "post": "This is a long read, so apologies for that. You can skip to the bottom for a TLDR. My aunt was traveling out of Mumbai today and I decided to drop her off at the airport as this was her first time on a flight out of Mumbai. I booked an Uber and the driver came. The fare that was shown was 238 rupees.\n\n1. He was not the person shown in the app. I questioned him about that, and he said the car's owner was someone else. I have encountered this before, so I let it slide (first mistake).\n2. I started loading the luggage in the car while my aunt gave the driver the OTP. I asked her to wait, but she was jittery and wanted to make it to the airport on time.\n3. My aunt realized she had forgotten her glasses so I rushed back home to get them.\n4. Once the cab began to move, I made the second mistake - I didn't check if the ride had started. My aunt was nervous about the travel so I was trying to calm her down. This diverted most of my attention off the app and to my aunt.\n5. Once we arrived at the airport, the driver showed me the fare was 475 rupees. I told him that was incorrect and opened the app to show him, and then realized that another ride had already been booked (this happens automatically when the driver cancels the ride if he hasn't started it).\n6. On noticing his phone, I realized he was showing me a screenshot and not the ride complete screen on his app.\n7. By now, my aunt started panicking about her flight, so I feigned ignorance and told him to let me drop her off at the counter and I would come back and make the payment.\n8. While I dropped off my aunt, calmed her down, and wished her goodbye, this dickhead was happily waiting in the cab for me.\n9. After I got back, I showed him that there was another booking that was automatically done. He blamed me for double booking. I canceled that ride and had to pay the cancellation charge.\n8. I told him that double booking isn't possible and I know how Uber works, and asked me to show the payment page again. He showed me the screenshot, which I pointed out.\n9. He said he takes screenshots of all his payments. I asked him why was the screenshot taken somewhere between Andheri and the airport was further from it. As in, why was the trip 'completed' there? He started mumbling some nonsense and he knew he was caught. I told him to show me his ride history, which he did, and it only showed on trip and that wasn't mine. He told me the app takes time to update the latest trips. I decided to wait for the 'update' with him.\n10. He then told me that if I was getting late, I could get off now and not make any payment. And when his app updates, he will send me the screenshot and I can pay him. I told him I could wait as I didn't have work today and had all the time in the world.\n11. He then said okay but he will have to circle around the airport and can't wait at the departure gate.\n12. I told him I was fine with that and I was willing to wait for hours too if needed.\n13. While driving around and waiting for the app to 'update', I tried calling Uber Customer Care (no answer), I tried seeing my old rides, I tried checking his old rides, etc. He kept telling me to be patient and it will update. My ride history did show his ride, but it was just his details. I couldn't complain, I couldn't report or anything. It was just the name of the driver. There was no ride started or canceled written or anything. Which I admit was weird.\n14. I told him that I have experienced this in Bangalore before and I know what he is doing and I am not going to let go of this.\n15. This is when he tried getting aggressive and started talking in Marathi saying this is Mumbai, the rules are different here.\n16. I replied in Marathi, which flustered him because he realized now he could not play the language card either.\n17. We kept roaming around the airport for 15 minutes waiting for the 'update'. He realized that this was a losing game and again asked me to get off and make the payment when the app 'updates' in my app and his app.\n18. This struck me very late (third mistake), but I realized that I could have just asked him to drive to the Uber counter at the airport and get this sorted. When I suggested this, he said he couldn't go there because of some (clearly made up rule). I told him there was nothing like this, and let's just go there.\n19. This is when he finally gave up and started begging me to get out of the cab and said that he did not take any money from me so why am I wasting his time and that he is losing fares, etc. I told him I was willing to pay the 475 rupees as long as there was proof and I didn't want to swindle him off his hard-earned money. He started folding his hands and all and kept requesting that I get off. I felt bad for him (fourth mistake).\n20. Finally, I let him off (fifth mistake) and exited the cab. When he drove off, I forgot to take a picture of the car (my last mistake).\n21. After that, I asked around and managed to find the Uber counter and asked them to make a complaint about this guy.\n22. They too were puzzled how this guy managed to game the system because while his ride was shown in my ride history, there was no way to report him. I could report the other drivers, but not him. But they confirmed that if I was auto-assigned another driver, that only happens when the driver doesn't start the trip and cancels it after a while.\n23. The Uber fellows just took a picture of the guy's account from my app and told me that they will follow up (which I know they won't).\n\nTLDR: Some Uber fellow tried to scam me by not starting the ride (which was completely my fault), and showing me some screenshots of some inflated payment, and when he was caught, he tried to weasel his way out. I didn't pay him anything, so no harm was done to me, but do not make the same mistakes I did. Always confirm the ride has started. I usually do this, but because my aunt was very nervous, my attention was diverted. Also, as usual, Uber helplines are useless.",

The passes say that the gates will open at 3 pm, after which there will be supporting acts from 5-8 pm. The actual concert is set to start at 8. I'm not really interested in the supporting acts and it'll be really frustrating to be there at 3 and wait for 5 hours for the main act. However, I'm worried that if I don't reach at 3, I won't get a decent place from where I can enjoy the concert. Any suggestions? ",

Ironically the shipping charges that were supposed to be free of cost for Prime users, were being added into the actual price of the product. \n\nThis incident got me thinking that I've been a Prime subscriber for years now. And the only relevant service linked to Prime I use regularly is Prime Video, which is becoming uninteresting these days. (I don't shop often, so I never get to understand the price difference in shipping cost. Prime music UI is shit for usage, so I never recommend it to anybody. And while Prime reading sounds enticing, it is worse than kindle unlimited as good books are never available for subscription.)\n\nSo I believe it is time to unsubscribe Amazon Prime and look for alternatives. What do you guys suggest here?? ",

        "title": "Inferiority of being from nalasopara",
        "post": "This is just a rant, but I needed to get it off my chest, so here it goes. I’ve lived in Nalasopara my whole life—attending school, making friends, and learning from teachers all from the area. Growing up, I never thought of the people around me as \"poor\" or \"less than.\" To me, they were just people—normal, everyday individuals who I shared my life with.\n\nHowever, things have changed since I moved to college. I now attend college in the Mumbai region, and while I’ve managed to make some great friends and enjoy my time with them, I can't help but feel like my background is constantly being thrown in my face.\n\nThere was one incident that stuck with me. I was at a restaurant with my college friends when I got a bad stomach, and the next day I had to take leave. Instead of showing concern for my health, my friends jokingly reminded me that I’m from Nalasopara, implying that people from there don't get stomach issues. It wasn’t meant to be mean, and I know they were just joking, but it still hurts. It felt like a constant reminder that I’m from somewhere \"lesser,\" like my background somehow makes me inferior.\n\nWhat really bothers me is that I can’t even think about liking someone who’s not from Nalasopara. Apparently, it’s not okay to have a crush on someone who lives outside of the area. Even if they don’t say it directly to my face, they imply this, “Why don’t you just date someone from Nalasopara?” It’s like I’m being boxed into this idea of who I should be based solely on where I’m from.\n\nHere’s the thing—I’m not even from a poor family. My family is financially stable, with respectable jobs and a good lifestyle. In college, I live just like anyone else. So why does it feel like my background defines me so much? Why is it so hard to escape this idea of being looked down upon just because of where I grew up?\n\nAt the end of the day, I’m left wondering: Why is my situation like this? What can I do to deal with it? How do I live with this constant reminder that I’m somehow \"inferior,\" even when I know that’s not true?",

Looking for places like libraries, parks, beaches, etc. Goes without saying but I'm low on money and would look to spend just enough to keep away. \nAlso would be great adventure finally to explore this city I was born and brought up in and never found the time to, 24M.

But they wouldn’t budge. To make matters worse, their customer support ended the chat abruptly and rudely, as if I were asking for something unreasonable or free.\n\nIf you’re considering ordering fashion items from quick commerce platforms like Zepto, think twice.

The college received the applications offline and many well qualified PHD Holders with various research publications applied for the said post.\n\nIt was later known that all these well qualified candidates were rejected and a certain guy from a TIER 3 city with Just a M.A. degree and NET/SET qualification was selected after he paid Rs. 70 lakhs as bribe to the Principal and the Management Committee.\n\nI was shocked and saddened by this rampant corruption that is going on in academic field. I had an idea that this went on in the more rural parts where the state of Aided colleges is far worse, but I was not expecting such a college who had been granted an autonomous status in a Tier 1 City to follow this path.\n\nAspiring professors, what are your thoughts/similar stories you've heard?",

        "post": "Do you lot have one of those days where everything around you seems awfully quiet, and you can’t help but wonder how you’re nearing 30 and nothing, absolutely nothing has gone the way you would’ve wanted it to? Not necessarily a negative outlook but I’m definitely not where I would’ve liked to see myself as a 10-12 year old. I’ve had my fair share of experiences with mental health and just life in general. I went from being the golden boy in my family to being the black sheep. I dropped out of university and couldn’t get a degree either, spent too many days in the moment and in doing so I realised one day that the first 30 years of my life had passed me by. Almost everyone seems to be ahead of me, because they put in the work, I didn’t do that. Perhaps I couldn’t because of mental health, but whom or what do I blame even now and not get pitted by the people around. “Ah he could’ve done so much if not for this or that, how sad?”. I learned long ago that to progress be it whatever, you need to own up to your shit. So I did that. I don’t want to feel sorry for myself, and have always been a fighter, but all of sudden I can’t help but feel how all of this is a sick fucking joke. You know how you always have a feeling when you’re younger, if not this at least i’ll be that. Nothing. I have such crumbling self-esteem now and teether everyday on the verge of losing all my self confidence if any of it is still left. I have lost all my friends. I have let my parents down. I fell in love, got married, but the marriage is dysfunctional bordering on toxicity and really all of this would’ve been fine, you have to work through life anyway, only, if only I still believed in myself. Like I said, I won’t give up, but it’s mostly because I don’t have any other choice. Responsibilities have certainly made me a better man, but somedays looking at every single person around me succeed and have the smallest of things work out for them that didn’t work out for me, hurts. Because they put in the work, I didn’t. Didn’t seem like a lot back then, but I guess the best of us our planners who see ahead. It took a huge part of me to accept the fact that I’m average and not ‘special’. Honestly all I want in my future is to be proud of myself. I want to give up so bad, but also if I could just put in the work today maybe i’ll like wherever I’m tomorrow. It perhaps still will be filled with regrets, but at the least my basket of done and dusted won’t be as empty as it is today. I have been clear that I do not want to have a child and what is good that my partner agrees as well, we both have our issues, honestly this seems like the beginning of practicality, a new decade. A decade of 30. ",

Buses are overcrowded. And the fact that you have to wait so long to get a sharing rickshaw or a bus that half of your time is gone in just waiting. \nPlaces to find these rickshaws and buses are really far from your offices. And that is almost half a kilometre or more, that you to walk all the way there because these buses and rickshawalas will drop you off at the main roads only.\n\nThis is so frustrating because you get squeezed in local trains travel and later it is hard to reach the office because public transport sucks anyway.\nAnd the fact, that many such working places don't even have a metro nearby, and if they do it wouldn't make sense because all the metro lines are not interconnected and you will have to get a bus or a rickshaw anyway.\n\nWhy can't all these companies/agenices help people leave early so they can reach home on time? Obviously, after you're done with the work. \nWhy can't such industrial areas come up with rickshaw/bus facilities that will help their employees reach there on time. \n\nWhy doesn't Mumbai yet have it's own Namma Yatri app like Bangalore does? \nWe seriously need more buses and rickshaws!\n\n We don't even have any hopes from the government, which are killing the best buses. And rickshawalas have their own set of rules.\nHaving a proper public transport will ease so much of travelling for everyone, this also includes mumbai local trains.\n\nNow, I know, many people have offices which are easy to reach via metro or bus or rickshaw. Or you're privileged enough to get a private rickshaw or your own car or a bike.\nThis rant is for people like me, who slog every single day in local trains then for a rickshaw or a bus. \nWe have to plan our travel in advance, have to leave an hour early so that we can get in the queue of buses and rickshaws, and yet can never reach on time because nothing in this country is on time. \nAnd, yes, traffic! \n\nI'm so damn tried of travelling like this! I'm exhausted all the time. Most of these workplaces don't even have a holiday on Saturdays, Sundays are gone so quickly. \n\nAt least, one mode of public transport should be easy! \n\nI hope things will improve soon. People won't take a stand because everyone's busy fighting for survival that we don't even have time to raise our voices.   ",

I was stunned—such a huge hospital, and yet no proper parking for visitors?\n\nFrustrated, I started searching for parking nearby, but had no luck. All the paid parking lots were completely full. Just as I was losing hope, a mysterious guy approached me and offered to park my car for me. He said he’d take the keys, give me his number, and call me when I needed the car back. The whole thing sounded shady, so I declined.\n\nDesperate, I went back to the hospital premises and practically begged the security guard for help, explaining it was an emergency. He finally relented, but not before subtly hinting he wanted ₹200. Left with no other choice, I paid him.\n\nThe whole experience left me completely drained. It’s frustrating and disheartening that in a city like this, even basic things like parking during an emergency become such a nightmare.",

Sure people ignore the ban to some extent, but it's a major help to quell the noise and make the city a more liveable place.",

        "post": "This is a rant guys. I’m furious and mildly frustrated regarding the state of affairs in our country. \n\nI am a very safe driver, I always try to be in speed limit and adhering to traffic rules. I have paid previous fines and have learnt all lessons. \n\nHowever these Lok Adalat notices keep coming and it seems like they’re targeting me because I pay up! \n\n- most of the fines are due to “NOT STOPPING BEHIND WHITE LINE” - CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHERE THE FUCK IS THE WHITE LINE!!!??? Most of the times either it has worn out or it’s not visible due to dust. Even if it is visible these rickshaw waalahs and bus waalaahs honk the fuck out of us and want us to move ahead even when signal is not working. It has happened so many times that I have stopped before the white line however either bus, rickshaw or bike will give me looks, shout at me and abuse me for not going ahead. \n\n- speeding fine- I don’t want to speed. I’m well travelled and a learned driver. To be honest in all countries there is 10% allowance in speed limit. I have fines where speed limit is 60 and they’re fining me at 62, 63\n\n- obstruction to traffic- we do not have proper infrastructure to park the cars and do our little work- sometimes we have to go and buy milk, bread, vegetables, parking is not found for miles. What are we supposed to do? I am not rich like other guys wherein I send servants to buy these things for me.

Like all of them, got my prints from Blinkit at home before leaving for the VFS office. \n\nBut, the Blinkit prints didn’t have 2 pages of itinerary booking of a particular stay of my trip. \n\nI was asked to get those prints at the country’s visa counter. I, by chance, saw the neighbouring counter had a printer: I asked if I can share the PDF & get the prints (I even insisted that I will pay). To which I was rudely asked to go down stairs & get a print. \n\nI go down, & am asked at the counter to send the PDF over. I do so, at the time of getting the print, the lady asks me which country I am headed to, I tell her the name, she says for my 2 pager Black&White print; I have to pay 150rupees. I was like WTF? Even New York’s downtown is less expensive for prints. What kinda sorcery is this?\n\nA minor caveat: I saw an aged uncle besides me who was asked which country (he said germany) & was asked to pay 150 too. He even uttered “kya kare ab majboori hai” and laughed it off. Honestly, might come off “provocateur” like cause to many, this might be a minor inconvenience of 150, but this just doesn’t sit well with me.\n\n1. Why are they asking people which countries they are going to & charging based on that?\n\n2. Why did they charge exorbitantly for something as basic as a print? I am 99.99% certain of this that: they have colluded with or asked Blinkit to not operate “prints” in that area. Because let’s be real, it’s mahalaxmi of all places a HQ-centric office region & you are telling me they are not getting demands there compared to a remote suburb I live in?\n\nTL,DR: Prints at VFS are more expensive than downtown NYC by 100% margins? the staff is scamming multiple people daily. I wanna take some action against them cause, “chalta hai” / “jaane de” attitude is kinda not cool you know. ",

        "post": "**What happened?**\n\n* Loksabha elections 2024 (Union/Central assembly elections) were held in April - June 2024 and the results were declared in 5th June declaring winner Mr. Vasantrao Chavan from INC/ Congress party for the Nanded Constituency of Maharashtra. Nanded Constituency in Loksabha elections is numbered as 16.\n* Unfortunately Mr. Chavan passed away in August 2024 and hence the seat was vacant.\n* Election commission hence also scheduled Bye-elections of Nanded constituency of Loksabha together with Vidhan sabha elections of Maharashtra which was done in 20th November.\n* Now Nanded constituency in Loksabha has 1 seat but for Vidhan sabha elections there are 6 sub constituencies which are as below:\n   * Bhokar (85), Nanded North (86), Nanded South(87), Naigaon (89), Deglur (90), Mukhed (91)\n   * So the delimitation boundary of Loksabha constituency of Nanded (16) is same as Vidhansabha's 6 sub consituencies as named above\n* So same voters that voted for Loksabha bye election of Nanded on 2oth November also votes for Vidhansabha election of 6 sub constituencies. They voted twice, one for Loksabha seat and one for Vidhan sabha seats on the same day. SAME DAY, SAME VOTERS, TWO VOTES\n* When votes were counted All 6 Vidhan sabha constituencies were won by NDA alliance not a single seat for congress, while the Congress again won the Loksabha constituency of Nanded. So congress wins Loksabha seat while BJP/NDA wins all 6 vidhan sabha seats !! HOW ??\n* All 6 Vidhansabha seats were fought by Congress only (Not any other party from MVA) and they lost all. HOW?\n* BJP+Sena  got 5,85,331 votes in Loksabha and 6,12,062 votes in Vidhansabha\n* Congress  got 5,86,788 votes in Loksabha and 4,27,465 votes in Vidhansabha\n* So 1,59,323 people went there to vote and pressed congress once and then chose BJP/Shiv sena/others. How is this possible ?\n\n  \n**Delimitation maps of Nanded constituency and Sub constituencies**\n\n[Vidhansabha map of constituencies](https://preview.redd.it/z86v9xgbzs3e1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=25dd90795841d4e05ff716ae90e5fef27d320e9d)\n\n[Loksabha map of constituencies](https://preview.redd.it/hpg2bwgbzs3e1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=280aa6654595e1b7eba843692bb175f7c92ed651)\n\n[Noth maps superimposed](https://preview.redd.it/on4nc0hbzs3e1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=defee09427a3d8c932c95626c2575427bad2dd6e)\n\n  \n**Table of vote count**\n\n||\n||\n|**Party**|**Loksabha votes**|**Vidhansabha votes**|**Difference**|\n|Bharatiya Janata Party|5,85,331|4,68,433|1,16,898|\n|Indian National Congress|5,86,788|4,27,465|1,59,323|\n|Vanchit Bahujan Aaghadi|80,179|93,125|\\-12,946|\n|Indian National League|19,900|91|19,809|\n|Buland Bharat Party|3,762|722|3,040|\n|Janhit Lokshahi Party|3,016|1,272|1,744|\n|Rashtriya Kisan Congress Party|1,236|0||\n|All India Majlis-E-Inquilab-E-Millat|1,117|486|631|\n|Republican Sena|1,064|612|452|\n|Rashtriya Samaj Paksha|1,002|1,618|\\-616|\n|Navarang Congress Party|983|0||\n|Independent|22,331|99,127|\\-76,796|\n|None of the Above|2,911|3,671|\\-760|\n|Bahujan Samaj Party|0|4,838||\n|Maharashtra Navnirman sena|0|1,368||\n|Jan Janwadi Party|0|463||\n|Janata Dal (Secular)|0|683||\n|Shiv Sena|0|1,43,629||\n|Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray)|0|22,706||\n|Republican Party of India (Khobragade)|0|184||\n|Bharatiya Yuva Jan Ekta Party|0|89||\n|Desh Janhit Party|0|56||\n|Sambhaji Brigade Party|0|135||\n|Bahujan Bharat Party|0|216||\n|All India National Raksha Sena|0|122||\n|Social Democratic Party Of India|0|428||\n|All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen|0|15,396||\n|Peasants And Workers Party of India|0|1,226||\n|Prahar Janshakti Party|0|19,723||\n|Lokrajya Party|0|251||\n|Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi|0|1,299||\n|**Total**|**13,09,620**|**13,09,434**||",

From the youthful days of night outs and parties to finding family friendly societies and kids schools, I have come a long way in my journey of life and this city never disappointed. Rarely did i feel frustrated with it, however small the houses, however jammed the roads, however steaming the weather. \n\nI changed two jobs, found my soulmate and got married, took a career break and started a business, had a kid, did another job and now finally sold the business. I could not have done this anywhere else but in my Mumbai.\n\nThe one true Metropolitan city in India, where Autos and taxis run on meters, the electricity never goes out and water is bountiful throughout the year, where language is never a barrier, nor is ethnicity, religion or caste, where distances are measured in minutes and not kilometres, where the daily life is an adrenaline rush, tiring but sinfully addictive, where people are absolute professionals in business and warm, welcoming and helpful at heart. \n\nThank you to the people of Mumbai for making this city the madness of a beauty that it is.",

I thought maybe it was a tech glitch, so I tried again with the same result..  money gone, no bottle.\n\nToday, I thought I’d give it another shot, assuming the issue last time was just a one-off. But again, the same thing happened — money deducted, no water bottle. What’s worse, there’s no one at the kiosk to help or even file a complaint.\n\nHas anyone else had this issue?

        "post": "So recently, I tried booking a bungalow in Alibaug, and let me tell you, it felt like solving a mystery rather than planning a weekend trip. Here’s how my adventure went (and yes, it was an adventure).\n\nFirst stop, Google Maps - because why not? Turns out, most bungalows there don’t even bother giving proper contact details. Like bro, how am I supposed to book it? Also, no one tells you the basics like:\n\nCan I use the kitchen?\n\nWill they allow non-veg food (because priorities)?\n\nAnd, most importantly, are they cool with pets?\n\n\nNext, I hopped onto Airbnb, thinking it’s the savior. But nope. The availability info is like a ghost, never there. I had to chat with the owner just to figure out the simplest details. Plus, their fees are insane. You see the price, and then they add charges like they’re selling the bungalow with a moon view package 😂.\n\nFinally, let’s not forget the Instagram influencers. They post dreamy reels of bungalows, saying, “Stay here for just ₹5,000!” But in reality? ₹5,000 is probably just the cost of using the driveway. Actual prices are like 3x what they promise.\n\nBut jokes apart, after Covid, bungalows and villas have become the thing, na? Everyone wants privacy, a big space to chill with friends or family, and no hotel wala restrictions. Makes sense, right?\n\nAnyway, tell me your stories. Have you also gone through this detective-level struggle to book a bungalow? Or do you have secret hacks to make it easier?\nLet’s make this thread fun and helpful for everyone planning their next getaway!",

I feel like I might not even get a bride, and even if I do, I can’t imagine spending my life with a stranger forced to marry me. The idea of children worries me even more. I’d be bringing them into a middle-class life where I will have to move out of Mumbai to even afford a house with 20-30k salary. If I have kids, they will face long commutes and challenges, and they might compare their life to others. This whole cycle of struggle and comparison would repeat itself.\n\nGiven all this, I sometimes think it might be better to stay alone.

Every one of them turned out to be a third-party service provider, even though they present themselves as official \"Aadhaar Seva Kendras,\" giving the impression of being government-operated. They even set up their offices to look like government workplaces.\n\nWhen I went there, they charged ₹350 for biometric and iris updates, even though the official government website lists the fee as ₹100. While I understand that third-party providers may charge extra, what truly bothers me is that within a 79 km radius, there isn't a single official Aadhaar Seva Kendra. I had to travel all the way to Andheri, Saki Naka, to get it done.\n\nTo make matters worse, their website is incredibly frustrating to use. It shows appointment availability, but when you try to book a slot, it repeatedly says the slot is unavailable. This happened at least 10 times, despite numerous attempts. Additionally, their mobile app is poorly designed its CAPTCHA code is partially hidden by the refresh button, making it nearly impossible to use.\n\nI'm absolutely tired of dealing with this pathetic service.\n\n",

Someone from my pocket (on the upper left as usual side) of the shirt took 500 Rs note and put 100 Rs inside. I had one 500 Rs note and one 20 Rs note in the pocket before.\nActually I was going to catch my train from LTT and hence took 500 Rs freshly from an ATM through which I was going to take a general ticket at LTT. I got to know about this theft when I came at the ticket booking window at LTT. After standing in the line for 10 minutes, when my turn came, I took out that one note and gave to the agent, at this moment I came to know that my 500 Rs note is somehow became a 100 Rs note. UPI/Railwire was also not working there and hence I got no ticket.\nWell, it happened to me because I wasn't aware that this type of theft also occurs. Does this ever happened to anyone else too? Other then this what are the other mishaps which are very probable to occur and everyone must be aware about them to save themselves in Mumbai local? I'll appreciate every tip/tricks/suggestions shared. Would love to discuss. Thanks :)",

Do I need to pay entire 3900 or should it be 50-50(owner and tenant). Also, I am obligated to pay the entire brokerage amount all over again for my 2nd year stay in the same apartment?",

To make things worse, the buses are either not on time or so overcrowded that I can’t even get in.\n\nI’m wondering if there’s a better way to travel from Andheri station to Powai Hiranandani? Maybe a share auto system or some alternative that’s less chaotic? To top it all I have to travel again in the Local and that is another task and another post in all but the daily grind is so exhausting that I’ve honestly considered quitting just because of the commute.\n\nAny advice or suggestions would mean a lot.\n\nForever tired,\nA fellow Mumbai local commuter",

        "post": "\nIt was a regular Monday afternoon, and traffic near Dahisar Check Naka was as chaotic as ever. I was waiting for the signal to turn green when a sharply dressed man in his late 40s approached my car. His outfit—a crisp white shirt, neatly pressed trousers, and polished black shoes—made him stand out among the usual crowd. He knocked on my window with a polite smile and gestured for me to roll it down.\n\nCurious, I cracked it open just enough to hear him out.\n“Bhaiya,” he began, his voice tinged with urgency and desperation, “I’m a taxi driver. My car is parked a little ahead, and I’ve run out of gas. I lost my wallet today, and I need ₹300 to fill enough gas to get me home. Please help me out; I’ll return it, I swear.”\n\nI glanced at him and then at the line of vehicles behind me. His demeanor seemed genuine, and his polished appearance threw me off. Against my better judgment, I handed him ₹300. He thanked me profusely and disappeared into the crowd.\n\nA few months later, it happened again. Same spot, same man, same story. This time, I recognized him instantly. “We’ve met before,” I said, narrowing my eyes. He hesitated for a moment before doubling down on his act. “No, sir, you must be mistaken. Please, I’m in real trouble.”\n\nI called him out, warning him not to try this trick again. He muttered something under his breath and walked away, blending into the crowd.\n\nBut it didn’t end there. Earlier this week, I saw him again, pulling the same stunt on another unsuspecting driver. This time, I kept my window up and gave him a sharp look of recognition. He quickly turned and moved on to his next target.\n\nIt’s clear this is a well-rehearsed act designed to exploit people’s kindness. His attire and polished speech are carefully chosen to disarm suspicion, but it’s all a scam. So if you’re ever near Dahisar Check Naka and a well-dressed man claiming to be a taxi driver approaches you, stay alert. Don’t let his appearance fool you, and certainly don’t fall for his story.\n",

A typical call went like - \n\n\"Dear FedEx customer,\nYour parcel has been stopped due to being prohibited from sending out. For more information, press 1.\"\n\nRecently, I pressed 1 and the call went to an Indian customer care. The guy asked my name to which I gave a random name. He then asked for my phone number, which I gave. He then started his speech that how my parcel is stuck at a Port in Iran and I have to recover it by paying.\n\nAt this point I said \"M***rch*d g*nd mei daal le mera parcel\" and cut the call. \n\nI know all about these scams but still fell for it. The part which worries me is that till I picked the call the scam number was Indian (+91). But now I'm receiving calls from African continent (+22). I'm worried if this may have repercussions as these guys now have my number and a (fake) name in their database. \n\nAlso, can anyone suggest how to save myself from these scam calls. Nothing works - DnD, Spam Filter et. al. Nothing.",

        "title": "Purse thief on inbound flight to Mumbai from Istanbul. If you see him, be careful of this vile person. ",
        "post": "I want to share a horrible experience on a flight from Istanbul to Mumbai that left me shaken. We were flying Turkish Airlines and I had asked my bf to place my small purse underneath the seat in front of him. Hours later, I asked him for my purse and he was not able to find it. We asked our flight attendant to help us search and the response was not very helpful. he merely asked the person in front of us if he had seen it (which of course, the person responded promptly with a no, without any attempt to search for it). The flight attendant told us we would have to wait until everyone left the airplane so that he could help us search (which doesn’t make sense bc if someone did take it, the thief would be gone by then)\n\nMoments later we decided to search again underneath our seats and we found my wallet and which surprisingly had everything still in it. My purse was, however no where to be found. My bf escalated this to the head stewardess who was happy to help us by informing the police and upon landing we would have the airplane be searched, meaning no one could disembark the plane. I didn’t want to make a fuss as I had my “found” my wallet already so I decided not to pursue the matter. \n\nOnce we started leaving the plane, I asked the person in front of me if he could search for my bag, he “attempted” to while the guy next to him, again made no effort. My suspicion was heightened when I realized how non-chalant and laissez faire he was to the matter. Then, as he was exiting from his row, I caught a glimpse of my purse protruding from underneath his zipped up jacket! I called out ‘hey that’s my purse!’ He responded ‘oh yeah let get out and we will see.’ I chased after him screaming stop him! He has my purse! \n\nHe walked really fast down to the gate and I had caught up to him and was facing him directly. I demanded he give my bag back, his was that we would take it to the lost and found. I again, demanded he alive me my purse. At this point, I was screaming and shouting, throwing expletives and such and made a big commotion as people were trying to head towards the gate. He starts walking again and I try to block him and stop him. I took the purse and tried to get it off his neck. At that point, my BF had caught up to me and managed to get it off his neck. He tried to tell anyone and everyone who worked there that this man should not leave and should be detained for stealing. No one really made an attempt to stop him. So when my BF found someone who would listen to him, the man tried to leave. In his rush, his bottle of duty free wine fell off his suitcase and shattered on the floor. \n\nHe tries to take off again and this time, the airport security caught on to him before customs and called for more reinforcement. In between listening to our complaints and his rather false accusations of doing no such thing wrong, it was quite the commotion. \n\nIn the end since we got our purse and thankfully all of my things were intact, we decided not to pursue any charges against him. \n\n#tldr vile man on plane tried to steal my purse, wanted to sue me for assaulting him and got instant karma handed to him.

Lately, I’ve been struggling with my living situation because of the environment—there’s constant smoking, and a lot of people come over, which has been taking a toll on my mental health.\n\nLast year, I trespassed Ramjharukha Society in Andheri West and absolutely fell in love with the place. It doesn’t feel like Mumbai at all, with all its greenery and peaceful vibe. I’ve been dreaming of moving out and renting a flat there, but I’m not sure how to go about it. \n\nI haven’t discussed this with my parents yet since they’re against me living alone, but I know that changing my living situation is essential for my well-being.\n\nIf anyone knows someone who lives in Ramjharukha Society or has contact details of brokers who handle flats there, I’d be so grateful if you could share them. I’m looking for a 1bhk flat there as I’m a student.\n\nAny advice or help would mean the world to me. Thanks in advance!\n\nFeel free to DM me or comment below.",

(it mentioned it'll take 9 minutes but it arrived in 3 minutes). i got on the train, it was fine, nothing special, but the train halted before mira road. i didn't mind it at first since trains halt in between stations all the time, but the train was halted for a whole 5 minutes.  \n  \n then, the train got on mira road, and stopped again after some time, before dahisar. now I was furious, I was supposed to reach borivali at 7:15 but I was stuck before dahisar at 7:20. the train was halted for a whole 10 minutes now, and everyone in the compartment was uneasy. at around 7:35 we reached dahisar, some left the train and many were busy calling their bosses/families about the incident how its getting late due to this issue.   \n  \nafter dahisar, the train halted twice, once at the dam/bridge and another just behind the station, I was infuriated at this point, the announcement was about to happen but the voice was glitching, everyone knew something was wrong, but yeah, we reached at the station 45 minutes late. and you know the funny part about this situation? all the other trains (for eg the ones that reach bhayandar at 7:30) went by but only this train was halted. that was the worst part of this situation.\n\n**TLDR: I took the 7:00 AM Churchgate fast train from Bhayandar, which arrived late and experienced multiple halts before Mira Road, Dahisar, and Borivali. The train was delayed for a total of 45 minutes, causing frustration among passengers, especially since other trains were not affected.**\n\n\n\n\n\n2- the same day, I was going home, I had reached bhayandar at around 12:50 - 1:00. as I was getting down from the bridge, I noticed the train on platform 4 halting in literally between the platform, the train honked thrice for some reason and stopped. i looked and was figuring out what happened and after a 10 minutes, I got to know that some accident happened. i couldn't see anything though, I cant confirm it. the train being halted in the middle of nowhere was lowkey scary. tldr\n\n# \n\n**TLDR: On my way home around 12:50-1:00 PM, I noticed a train on platform 4 at Bhayandar halt midway on the platform after honking three times. After 10 minutes, I learned there might have been an accident, but I couldn't confirm it. The unexpected stop was unsettling.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nhxcj75gz93e1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbc9c4abfea5c34a44baf29467c2d57d12eea7ee\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4goluliiz93e1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b44082714689d8cc12b65710e16a059e8541372a\n\ni know these two situations do not co-relate, but experiencing these on the same day has me frozen. your thoughts?",

It hit 2 or 3 people on the bridge by its horns but thank God those blows were light and not had full swing, maybe the cow wasn't having the worst day.\n\nIt left the people terrified. I just wondered what would have happened if the cow truly showed it's full force.\nWould have almost killed a person.\n\n\nAnd that fucking tai was behind without any care for the cow. I couldn't say something to her because ofcourse she looked poor and tbh I didn't want to quarrel with such people. People like these are also  the reason why India is still a third world country",

However, within two months, I noticed a wave of departures and learned that the Indian conglomerate holding the licensing rights to the brand no longer retained them. Unfortunately, this information wasn’t disclosed during the hiring process, even though it was likely known at higher levels.\n\nDespite this setback, I remained optimistic as the conglomerate had recently acquired two prestigious international brands. I was assured I would transition into one of them, which kept me motivated. However, the entire period has been a remote work setup with little to no structured guidance or training. After the initial brand was phased out, I was instructed to focus on \"meetings,\" which proved challenging given my lack of background in this field.\n\nEventually, I was placed within one of the acquired global brands. While I was upfront about my inexperience and need for hands-on training, the support provided was limited to virtual lessons that didn’t sufficiently address the practical aspects of my role. My new manager initially attempted to guide me but seemed to expect results too quickly, shifting to an approach where I was left to figure things out largely on my own.\n\nOver the past eight months, I’ve worked hard to independently learn every detail of my responsibilities—often without even knowing the right questions to ask at first. Recently, I was informed that my probation period would be extended due to the need for \"more learning.\" While I acknowledge there’s always room for growth, I firmly believe that with proper tools, training, and support from the beginning, I could have performed much more effectively in this role. Goes without saying, I feel lost and a little demotivated, any advice, suggestions feedback would honestly help me",

        "post": "So I was one of the lucky folks who managed to book a Coldplay ticket through BMS. I've been reading about ID verification being deployed at Coldplay concerts in Mumbai.\n\nI was wondering if it's even possible to do ID verification at any event attended by 1 lakh people?\n\nFull disclaimer: I am from Delhi. Brain is oxygen deprived and stomach is full of cheap alcohol from Gurgaon. So it's possible my calculations are wrong. Mumbai folks will obviously have better idea about this. Feel free to correct them. \n\nI did some back of the envelope calculations for any event of this size (Not just Coldplay concerts). I am considering the following variables: \n\ne: No..of turnstiles/ entry points\nN: number of concertgoers \nt: time taken per person to go through turnstiles/entry point\nT: Total time to grant entry to all concert goers\n\nT = t * N/e\n\nBasically, the total time to allow entry to all concert goers is time taken per person multiplied by number of persons going through each entry point. Because the total crowd of 1 lac will be going through multiple parallel entry points.\n\nNow we know,\nN = 100000\nt = 20 seconds (assumption)\ne = 100 (assumption)\n\nT = 20*100000/100 = 20000 seconds = 5.5 hours !!!!!\n\nAnd this excludes the time for security checks. So either entry starts 6 hours before the show or most people are not able to enter the venue!\n\nExplanation of assumptions:\n\nNumber of entry points (e): I am assuming that organizers will deploy 100 turnstiles or points where tickets will be scanned and IDs verified in parallel. I think cricket stadiums have 40-50 (?). Happy to be corrected.\n\nTime taken per person to go through entry point (t): I have taken the generous assumption of 20 seconds per person. Realistically it should be 30-60 seconds per person. From my experience at other concerts and cricket matches, it takes about 7-15 seconds for a person to scan a ticket and go through the turnstile. If you implement ID verification then it will take an additional 10-15 seconds to do a cursory check of the person. Scans fail. Checkers get distracted. So realistically it will be higher than 30s.\n\n",

I think it's a flawed argument and money has no relation to having the need of a child or more. So is it true that upper middle class households of Mumbai usually have more than one kid at home?( I think single kid households should be in large numbers too irrespective of the class since some people are genuinely satisfied with one kid irrespective of them affording multiple)[also I mean no offense to anyone when I talk about classes, i belive all are equal irrespective of so called socio financial class]",

        "post": "So for the context: There was this girl from my college, we started talking in March this year so through that we started talking a lot then we were a talking stage and then a situationship. This continued for like 3 months. I had confessed to her but there was no commitment, But we both were attached to each other. We went on dates multiple times and all was going good. But out of sudden one day she tells me that she does not think that we are going to work out, So then I was very much attached to her and I was heartbroken that it didn't work out. \n\nSo every time I was sad I vented to my best friend from our college which happens to be my room mate also. He knew everything about me and her. How and what I feel about her and all that stuff. Also he assisted me in the confession thing where we planned a whole gift, letter and chocolate thing while proposing to her. So this was the context.\n\nNow comes the real part of the story. So, today they both come to me and tell me that they both are dating now. They told me that they were on a trip ( first week of November) together with few other people where they both were totally drunk and confessed feeling for each other and they thought of things and they were asking for my approval if they should date or not as he knew I liked her and I'm not totally moved on till now (I'm almost but still there's a little void) so I did not say anything to them at the moment, I just laughed on the situation and let the moment pass by and left in 5 minutes. Later I got to know that, from past few weeks he lied to me at multiple times and he went to meet the girl. Like he told me he is going to meet one his childhood friend who recently shifted in the city but they were going on a date lmao, in one more case tells me he is going to meet one his older friends who is going to assist him about the higher studies admission and went to meet her. \n\nI was freezed hearing this that he has done this to me. I am not sad that they are dating i am just sad that he broke the bro code ( i feel maybe wrong assumption) and did not care about how will I feel I trusted him a lot and I never thought he would ever do this to me. Today he comes and asks *if he has violated the bro code?*, I just laughed. Now the thing is our whole friend group is fucked now, because of this, and I don't know what do with? Should we keep our friendship or stop talking completely and change rooms maybe? Girl I will not talk obviously but I cared about my friendship with my roommate? What should I do?\n\nEdit: I forgot the part that, they had tied rakhi to each other lol, I know it does not mean anything but it's just funny.\n\nEdit 2: I have read all of your replies guys and I was not in a good mental state from past few days, so I could not reply to every one, but I am very thankful for your advices and once again thank you so much for taking time and writing it out for me.
