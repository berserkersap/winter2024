I can only think of Pastry Chef since before COVID-19, with the same quality, size, and marginal price rise. \n\nFeel free also to list places that went worse recently. Thanks",

There 100s of people in the premise and by the time we reached the screen it was a stampede and there was no room to even walk inside and if you managed to get inside you can hardly get a peek of the screen cuz people were standing on seats and it was utter chaos. The management of the theatre couldn't manage and the police couldn't control anyone. We came down to talk to the management at box office and demanded the show to be restarted or give us refunds. At first management and police agreed to give refunds but within 10minutes they forced us out of the premise. Once we were on the road, the police wanted to beat us and make us leave the area. So paid 1k per head for a premier show but we got shoved away by police. (I was personally shoved away) My friend didn't get any refund who got us the tickets and he lost his slippers + broke his spectacles. ",

A good soul human saw me requesting that cloak room guy and told me that there are Digital luggage lockers right opposite to cloak room. The process is very simple there is a screen and you need to fill in your details and the size of lockers are 2 types medium and large. I used large locker and it is very very big i placed my 77cms safari trolley bag a duffle bag 2 laptop bags and a bike helmet and still there is much space left in the locker. Prices are 140/- for 6 hours and 270/- for 24 hours. Something like this should be kept in vizag railway station too. Forgot to take a picture",

The thing is, when I calculated my current diet, I noticed about 50% of my calories are coming from carbs. ChatGPT suggested I should be eating 30-35% carbs instead.\n\nI'm really confused about what proportions I should follow for protein/carbs/fats. Can anyone who's done successful body recomp share their macro splits?\n\nSome background: I did 3 months of bulking before this. Previously I was skinny with a big belly (classic skinny fat). Looking back, I'm not sure if I should have done body recomp instead of bulking at that time.\n\nAnyone here who's done body recomposition successfully? What macro split worked for you? Is my current 50% carb intake too high?\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "post": "Hi Redditors,\n\nI’m working on an upskilling platform aimed at empowering rural youth in Andhra Pradesh (AP), especially in tier 3 towns and villages. Our goal is to help students and young adults gain skills and access freelancing opportunities to boost their income.\n\nHowever, one major roadblock we’re facing is **reliable internet access in rural areas**. To make our platform accessible, we’re exploring affordable and dependable options for internet connectivity in these regions.\n\nIf you’ve had experience with or know of solutions for rural connectivity in AP, could you share your recommendations? Here are a few specifics we’re looking at:\n\n1. **Wi-Fi Hotspots:** Affordable services/providers that work well in remote areas.\n2. **Mobile Data:** Best prepaid/postpaid plans with good coverage in rural AP.\n3. **Satellite Internet:** Viable low-cost options, if any...\n\nWe want to ensure uninterrupted access to video tutorials, online resources, and freelancing tools for our students.\n\nThanks in advance for any insights or tips! 🙌\n\nP.S. If you know of organizations or projects already working on similar goals, please let me know. Collaborations are always welcome! 🌟",

        "post": "I wanted to take a moment to appreciate the flavourful chutneys of Andhra Pradesh. I am a North Indian, brought up in Visakhapatnam. I have always had a special place for south Indian breakfast.\n\nI have stayed in Vizag for around 7 years and in Vijayawada for 6 years. Being a Vegetarian, one thing that I have enjoyed eating a lot outside are tiffins. But I never realised  how important yet underrated the chutneys are. I am basically that guy who needs chutney in litres. \n\nWhen I moved out of Vizag this year for work to bangalore,  I travelled to many cities from here: Mangalore, Mysore, Chennai, Kochi. I had breakfast at some of the so called finest eateries: MTR, Rameshwaram Cafe, Vidhyarthi Bhavan and also at popular roadside eateries.\n\nWith the hype around all things, one thing that was extremely tasteless in all of these places were the chutneys. Flavourless, pale without character, they felt like they just existed for the sake of it. Everytime I would eat out, I could only think and talk about the rich flavours of chutney my city had to offer.\n\nI never imagined I would end up missing chutneys from my city but yes I did. Allam, tomato, onion even the basic palli chutney tastes so yummy🤌. I am writing this down, siting at MTR, having paid 80₹ for a single piece of vada with a shitty tasteless chutney acting as if this is the best tiffin I have had in my life in front of my colleagues.",

We approached all nearby available houses first.. I am a Doctor.. However, Most of the owners asked me \"WHAT I AM\" right at the first meet itself and when I mentioned SC, they said they won't give.. That's OK.. I am used to these.. and I am glad that they denied me right away.. No time wasted\n\nBut with one owner, after 2 days of talking & agreeing verbally, finally when he asked my Aadhar to make a written agreement, he saw my surname & enquired about my caste.. He too denied as expected but at the last moment... Waste of time and money ( My wife ordered some furniture & a wooden Pooja place which the house lacks... Had to cancel them all )\n\nInterestingly, the number of people rejecting because of my caste relatively increased compared to 4 years before (the last time, when I searched for a house)\n\nI am not saying all owners are rejecting based on Caste though..\nSome houses, the rent is way too much which I simply can't afford..\n\nI searched for houses from Maddilapalem to Yendada, Visalakshi Nagar too.. 99% of the available houses are out of my budget..\nMy budget limit is 10k for 2BHK, 15k for 3BHK\n\nSo, kindly help me with these\n1) Affordable places in Vizag at a decent commutable distance to Arilova Health City which falls under my budget ?\n\n2) If I mention my Caste, >70% chances are I won't be given a house.. My wife belongs to an upper Caste though.. Can I mention her caste and hide mine..? or will that cause any future problems if they ever find out that a SC guy lived in their house without them permitting",

It is a reminder of the transience of human existence, and the power and unpredictability of the natural world.\nI can imagine the stories of the crew who once sailed aboard the ship with a tale of adventure and survival on the high seas which lead to this journey. Also I can picture the emotional impact of the abandoned ship - the feelings of loneliness, fear, and despair that may have overcome the crew as they realized they were stranded with no hope of rescue.",

        "post": "Back in 2016, I went to The Park for a date night with my then-fiancé. It was one of those moments that stays with you forever. I still remember it like it was yesterday—just the two of us, sitting in the open-air area, with the sound of the waves crashing against the shore in the background. There were these beautiful bamboo structures nearby that added to the serene vibe.\n\nAnd the food—oh, the food! The biryani was out of this world, the perfect balance of spices, and the raita? It somehow made everything taste even better. It elevated the mood, the ambiance, and the connection we felt that night. We had an incredible time, just the two of us enjoying the moment. And now, looking back, it feels even more special, especially since we’re married now and have a kid.\n\nFast forward to 2024, and I recently decided to revisit The Park, hoping to relive that magic. Unfortunately, it was anything but magical. It was honestly one of the worst dining experiences I’ve ever had. The food was awful—nothing like the biryani I remember—and the place felt dated, with old, tired vibes that didn’t match the charm it once had. It was disappointing, to say the least.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Have you experienced something like this, where a place you once loved completely changed over time?",

I'm registerd under gajuwaka rto.  I’m getting a bit concerned as I’m not sure how long it typically takes or whom I should contact to get an update on the status.\n\nHas anyone experienced a similar delay? Can anyone guide me on the process for getting the RC delivered? Is there any specific  online portal where I can track its status? Any advice or help on this would be greatly appreciated! \n\nThanks in advance! ",

        "post": "This is quite odd but for me it's my sports teacher. For some reasons when I was in 7th grade, I was badly abused physically, to cover it up, the teacher labelled me as a rebel, arrogant rude and the most atrocious kid. It was told repeatedly in the staff room and teachers would be scornful of me and taunt me every once in a while or be scared of me for the way it was exaggerated.\n\nI carried the image for quite a while. My sports teacher was under the same impression as well it actually bothered me a lot that they'd see me as a criminal of sorts, but then there wasn't anything I could do to change it. Anything I did was seen in the same angle and they would just confirm their biased perspective of me.\n\nAnyway, I was in my tenth grade and my schooling was ending, there was some annual day event and we had a lot of work to do in the sports ground. There were no classes and I was jobless roaming around so I thought I'd help out him with placing the ropes or throwing the powder to make lines for march past etc. It was a normal thing, ot wasn't a lot but it wasn't less but there was no one else who was there to help him. After all the work is done he realised that I was nothing like people would talk about me. He saw me as a sweet and a helpful kid. He told me how different he was thinking of me from before. \n\nI'm slow at writing my exams I think a lot. In my final board exams he was among the invisilators and he actually gave me extra time to write for almost all the exams. It was very sweet of him. I met him a few years after school. He told me the same stuff about his impression on me changed. It gave me some redemption arch sorta thing. It was such a relief for me.\n\nBonus: Since you've read it this far. I want you to know that I'm a teacher now I'm pretty darn sure I'm THAT favourite teacher to almost all of the 100s of students I've taught in my 3-4 years of teaching experience so far. Some even heard of me from there younger siblings and became fond of me. My final question paper of mine made my students laugh for 5 mins straight. If you wanna have a glimpse how fun filled and a vessel of love laughs and smiles my classroom is, DM me, I can share my insta handle where I posted a few videos of these.",

Some don't return calls, while others promise to visit the apartment but never follow through. Additionally, many seem interested only in full home renovations rather than smaller projects like ours.\n\nDoes anyone know of any contractors who handle bathroom renovations specifically? Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!",

The shopkeeper who said  ₹2100 was honest and told me it was a third-party battery with less backup than an original one, offering a 6-month warranty. Other shops claimed to sell original batteries, but the \"original\" battery prices were having more than 1k difference.\n\nI don't mind getting a third-party battery as long as it doesn't damage the motherboard or other components. I'm just looking for recommendations from anyone who recently bought a new battery and can suggest a reliable place to get one.\n\nThanks\n",

It took a week to have grasp on the events and task accordingly. Situations demanded me to work like a clock which was obeyed for later 3 months. Unknown-behest to me, stress was accumulating quite evident from my erratic moods at times. \n\nSlowly realising this, I just want to get out, travel and escape from all the shit. I was stopped by humungous water body and piece of sand accumulating it. I frequented my visits to beach and its repetitive motion, gushing wind, cool breeze and no reaction or response to my vent worked like a theraphy.\n\nI began not worry about the future or destiny, focus on things at hand. I started a routine - morning walks, exercise, work and beach rides. I began to enjoy this. In due period of last 8 months, I have connected with my family members well, learnt car driving which has been delayed for long, worked out, got 3 unsuccessful dates 😅, made some strange acquaintances, I am little more confident now than i was year back.\n\nTime has come to say goodbye like a ruthless unapologetic villain in this fairy tale.

Is this a deep breath, or an end in chaos?\n> My heart is full with this struggle within me,\n> It feels like I've forgotten myself, is this pain or something else.\n> Unable to drift into slumber... Unable to escape its grasp\n> What a strange race mine is... will my journey not complete.\n> If you're by my side, time has no value.\n> When you drift away, this moment feels like poison.\n> With rain ahead, clouds clash,\n> In my heart, a storm begins to swell... Is this a deep breath, or an end in chaos?\n> My heart is full with this struggle within me,\n> It feels like I've forgotten myself, is this pain or something else.\n> In the innocence of youth, seeds were sown... Oo Oo Oo Ho\n> But the heights we’ve reached are beyond our control... Oo Ho\n> Now the flowers have bloomed... Oo Oo Oo Ho\n> Who is going to cut them now everytime? Oo Ho\n> The paths that spoke when you were with me...\n> But now, all those paths are leading astray.\n> My eyes, they were lakes for dreams... Oo Oo Oo Ho\n> But why are they slipping away in tears? Oo Ho\n> The cool breezes of my evenings... Oo Oo Oo Ho\n> Why have they turned into whirlwinds? Oo Ho\n> The heaven that lasted so long has turned into hell.\n> Is this torture not affecting you?!\n> With rain ahead, clouds clash,\n> In my heart, a storm begins to swell... Is this a deep breath, or an end in chaos?\n> My heart is full with this struggle within me,\n> It feels like I've forgotten myself, is this pain or something else.\n> Unable to drift into slumber... Unable to escape its grasp\n> What a strange race mine is... will my journey not complete.\n> If you're by my side, time has no value.\n> When you drift away, this moment feels like poison.\n> With rain ahead, clouds clash,\n> In my heart, a storm begins to swell...

I looked for regions in mana city which had very good neighbourhood planning and land use, along with good walkable infrastructure. \n\nThe only good region sadly which satisfied all the criterion was the Dolphin Nose Region and if you consider Housing Complexes near PM Palem and Law College, they too might be but im not considering them. \n\nWhat other regions come to your mind when you think about well planned areas in Vizag? Do anything come to your mind? Or are the houses just random erections wherever?\n\nCan greenery be prioritized? Are the natural hills surrounding vizag going to disappear in the next few years? Or can we be sustainable?\n\nI'm scared Vizag Map nunchi greenery ane padam teesestaaru emo ani. \n\nAlready a few city center regions look like Uttam Nagar in Delhi. \n\nIt is sad to think Urban Planning cannot be prioritized for a beautiful city like ours.  \n\n[Dolphin Nose Naval Quarters](https://preview.redd.it/jknaf5i3z7kd1.png?width=2532&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0bbf288e35c1d662ee4d23638679f3cb82af948)\n\n",

        "post": "Lately we've been hearing cases of mobile phones put in dustbins (third wave coffee house, bengaluru) and fake ceilings of public places (Anandam restaurant, uttarakhand), coffee shops and some guys even going as far as trying to record women using the washrooms at the theatres too. It's honestly scary and depressing to know that we gotta keep looking out every damn place we go. \n\nPlease be cautious though, when you're going to public places and using their washrooms or restrooms.   \n  \n> Try **double checking your surroundings**, dustbins, ceilings etc. for suspicious electronic devices. Be it public toilets or the ones in cafes, hotels, restrooms, or malls, clubs.  \n  \n> Also, when you're using trial rooms at clothing stores, **do check the mirrors to see if they're normal ones (safe) or two way mirrors (unsafe)**. You can do the **fingertip test** (put your fingertip against the mirror and if there's a gap between your tip and the reflections, it's safe and if there's no gap, that means it's a two way mirror and it's not safe.) or the **knocking test.** (A two-way mirror might produce a less solid sound compared to a traditional mirror, due to its different construction and the space typically behind it.)\n\n  \n> Keep an eye on your drinks. carry your drinks, prefer bottled stuff if you're outside, buy your own stuff. Get a power bank if you're going out, normally for a couple of hours or on trips and stuff, just in case your phone runs out of juice. share your location/trip/outing details with your parents or atleast two or three friends. Keep updating them about your whereabouts. Share your ride details - cab or bike. carry a pepper spray with you. you can get one off amazon. \n\n(in case you don't have a power bank and your phone runs out of juice, make sure you try to remember or note down the numbers of your parents/friends in a handy notebook and carry it on you and inform them beforehand through a call - from someone's cellphone at a public place like a cafe or store. if you're outside, pretend like you're on a call with someone. there are apps/audios online that you can download, which have audios that you can use to pretend like you're on an actual call. try googling about it. **do it even if your phone is switched off)**\n\nMost importantly, **trust your gut**. Trust nobody except yourself. If you have wonderful and trustworthy people with you, it's well and good. But it's always better to trust your instincts and keep an eye out.\n\n**If you're a girl reading this, please remember and please tell your friends too. If you're a guy, please tell your mother/sister/cousins/any other female friends that you have.**\n\nFeel free to add any other (\"sensible\") points you can come up with. ",

Since there are only 2 direct trains one at 6 45 and 21 20 i can't catch both of them. Surfing i found that we can go to Araku from Bobbili. I found train at 9 which goes to Bobbili but i don't know how to reach Araku from there. Are buses available there? I can spend a night at Araku but I need to catch a train at 18 20 in Vizag the next day. And i don't know how I'll roam in Araku. Will autos be available in Araku? Ideally I want to take an Auto from Bobilli to Araku. Is it possible? Will it be worth travelling to Araku with this schedule? I've searched APSRTC for buses to Araku but i didn't find any. Thank you. ",

        "title": "Why hindi?",
        "post": "It has come to my attention that schools in Tamil Nadu typically offer five subjects at the primary and high school levels, and Hindi is not a mandatory part of the curriculum. While I acknowledge the importance of learning multiple languages, I believe that the decision to study Hindi should be optional, based on individual needs and future requirements, rather than mandatory.\n\nMy concern is that if students are required to study a language they may not use regularly, the knowledge could eventually fade. Instead of dedicating an hour each day for ten years to a language that might not be actively practiced, it could be more beneficial for our younger generations to use that time to focus on physical education or sports.\n\nTamil Nadu, like many other states, has not been heavily represented in the Olympics or other international sports events. By reallocating time from less critical subjects to physical education, we could nurture more athletes who might excel at national and international levels, promoting a healthier and more active lifestyle among students.\n\nAdditionally, studies have shown that regular physical activity can improve cognitive function and academic performance, suggesting that prioritizing sports could have a positive impact on overall student development. By striking a better balance between academics and physical activity, we can better equip our children for the future.\n",

That being said, vizag is a brilliant city, given all the many historical monuments that are present (all the hills, marine/port history, temples/churches et. al.) \n\nIt pains one to see that while there exist reasonable structures and locations, there is little to read/see online about these places and the city in general, leave alone tourists, most dwellers know little to nothing. \n\nIn this void, I found perugupackettu's Instagram listing his brilliant work in covering the aspects, not only exploring text-sources, but also covering oral histories transmitted to and from the older residents of the city. \n\nI was on a casual run along the footpath, and found him interviewing an older gentleman in front of the Tu-142 museum. \n\nWhen I shook his hand, he expressed his genuine surprise of being noticed by a viewer and mentioned that this interaction made him feel like a celebrity :D \n\nI don't know about you all, but to a man who's making the history of my favourite city known is a forever celebrity in my eyes!\n\nHighly recommend you stumble across his work whenever you can to know a little more about this coastal beauty.
