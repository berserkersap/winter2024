        "post": "Today has been one of the worst days since I started living in Bengaluru. I never expected to face such hostility simply for being from another state. I was suffering from mild diarrhea and decided to go out to get some medicine. The pharmacy isn‚Äôt too far from my place, but since I was feeling weak, I chose to take my bike instead of walking.\n\nI had barely traveled 100 meters when a child, no older than six, suddenly ran in front of my bike. I was riding extremely slowly, so thankfully, the child only sustained minor injuries‚Äîone near the chin and another on the stomach. Despite feeling unwell, I immediately stopped, lifted the injured child, and checked on him.\n\nBefore I could process what was happening, a group of locals gathered around me, aggressively grabbing me and my bike. They forcefully took my keys and refused to return them. They had no right to touch my bike, but their sheer hostility left me shocked.\n\nI repeatedly told them I was willing to cover the child‚Äôs medical expenses, but instead of understanding, they spat words filled with hatred: \\textit{‚ÄúDo you treat people from your state like this?‚Äù} The underlying prejudice in their voices was painfully clear.\n\nWhen they realized that the situation could escalate into a formal police procedure involving an MLC, they quickly changed their stance and demanded ‚Çπ10,000 from me. I refused, and they again resorted to threats and intimidation.\n\nI immediately called the police. Their arrival seemed to be the only thing that made the locals back off. They returned my bike, and I took the child to the hospital for treatment. What saddened me even more was the child‚Äôs parents' behavior. His father was informed about the accident just minutes before we reached the hospital, and instead of focusing on his child‚Äôs well-being, he seemed far more concerned about extracting money from me.\n\nThe entire cost of treatment came to around ‚Çπ3,500‚Äîfar less than the ‚Çπ10,000 they had demanded earlier. When the parents realized they wouldn‚Äôt get the money they were hoping for, they couldn‚Äôt hide their frustration but were forced to remain silent, knowing the law was now involved.\n\nThis incident is just one of many where non-residents of Karnataka are treated with hostility. The level of prejudice I faced was both shocking and heartbreaking. It made me realize how deeply rooted such state biases can be, and how difficult it is to navigate such situations when people choose hostility over sanity.",

I reported it to the owner immediately, and he said he'll send the plumber to take a look at it and repaint the flat once the damp is gone. Fast forward to 5 months later, the damp has only gotten larger. The plumber has fixed leakages in the bathrooms multiples times, but the damp comes back. I've reported it to the owner, but there's been no resolution so far\n\nWhat can do in such a situation? I don't mind the damping wall as much, but it's not fair that we're overpaying for the flat, when it has such a significant problem. I also want to avoid any breaking of walls while I'm staying in the flat. ",

After the movie, we headed to the parking lot to get my bike. First off, they charged ‚Çπ20 for parking, but the whole setup was horrible. Bikes were stuffed in so tightly that they were literally touching each other, and the exit path was so narrow that only one or two bikes could somehow squeeze through.\n\nNow comes the real drama. There‚Äôs only one gate used for both entry and exit, and things were bound to get chaotic. The right side of the gate leads to D-Mart, which is just beside the theatre. My friend and I wanted to go there, but the left side of the gate was packed with traffic and completely jammed. Since no one was entering the theatre anyway, I decided to take the right side to quickly get to D-Mart. That‚Äôs when the parking guys, more like local rowdies, lost it.\n\nThere were six of them, and they started yelling like maniacs, hurling filthy abuses at me and my friend. They acted like they owned the place! One guy folded his tongue and started barking at us, and three of them even raised their hands, ready to hit us. These fellows behaved like proper gundas! It felt so unsafe that for a moment, we thought of just ditching the bike and leaving.\n\nComing to the theatre itsel total disappointment! The screen was dim, and they didn‚Äôt even use the full audio output. I know the kind of sound and video quality this theatre is capable of because I‚Äôve watched other movies here before. But clearly, they don‚Äôt care anymore.\n\nBrundha Theatre is a disgrace. Poor management, rowdy parking staff, and substandard facilities make it one of the worst experiences I‚Äôve ever had.

She asked me if she can make a call, telling me that the person who she wants to talk to has blocked her. Though I was skeptical, I did say okay as she looks distressed and dialled the number and put it on speaker. There was a guy talking and I could hear that he‚Äôs in some office or maybe working (Could hear background noises). She told him that she‚Äôs pregnant and wants him to talk to her, but he responded saying that I‚Äôm at work right now and won‚Äôt be talking to you. I did ask her if she‚Äôs okay, she said she‚Äôs not, and she told me she‚Äôs pregnant. Though I felt sorry for her, I was afraid if this is a scam, I asked her specific questions, like why are you here, she told me that she‚Äôs come to her boyfriend‚Äôs place, but he isn‚Äôt home, and if he gets to know that she‚Äôs at his place, he won‚Äôt be coming home. I asked her if there‚Äôs anyone coming to pick her up, she told me that a friend of her is coming, but he‚Äôs in Whitefield at the moment. I asked her if she‚Äôs planning to go somewhere, she said no, I just told her to take care and left. Though I felt sorry for her, I was genuinely afraid if it‚Äôs a scam. I did check the number in CRED to see if it has a UPI name attached to it and it matches with the name she said when talking to him. How do you know if it‚Äôs a scam or genuine?",

Artists like Dua Lipa, Justin Beiber, Coldplay, Maroon 5, Marshmallow, Linkin Park, Ed Sheeran, Martin Garrix, and many more almost never include South cities in their India tour. We don't always see music festivals like Sunburn, Vh1 supersonic too happening annually in South. Among all this, Bangalore stands out as the sole contender in South that does get and attract some of these artists and shows. Like the recent Dil-Iluminati tour of Diljit. Ed Sheeran, too, is aligned to host a concert in Bengaluru around Feb. We have some remote events of Sunburn happening. We sometimes see concerts of Shreya Ghosal and Sonu Nigam happening top. Why does neither of Chennai or any city in Kerala or Vishakhapatbam get these events? Hyderabad does receive some, but is also mostly excluded. Are artists not interested to perform in Chennai? Do artists not see business potential? As per the preference list, the entire South is excluded more often than not, but if South is picked, we see Bangalore taking the first spot, followed by Hyderabad, with cities like Chennai, Kochi & Vizag often being left behind neglected.

I liked the flat and gave a booking amount of 30k on spot to brokers gpay. The broker later sent me the confirmation mail(12 days later) from official email id confirming a date and floor on which i booked the flat. \n\nFast forwarding to 2 weeks now broker calls me and tells me that the flat wont be available for a few more days. I was ok with it and even agreed to extending the date for 5 more days. \n\nFast forwarding a few more days the broker calls me and says the flat isn‚Äôt available anymore and he can give me another flat in same society 3 weeks later than agreed date. \n\nNow the game starts the broker tells me that i can book another flat by paying 30k more on top of 30k i already paid. But i was not ok with it and asked for a refund, but broker tells me that there is no way i can get any refunds and if i wanna go to police or consumer court or any other channel then nothing will happen. \n\nBeing a IT professional in this city for last few years this is the worst experience i faced renting any property, and when i searched reddit then found out nestaway has done this to thousands of people for last few years. \n\nThis is such a scam and people lose their hard earned money so often to this fraudulent company. I would suggest anyone in the city to stay far away from Nestaway. There are other honest people and companies which offer way better services and properties. \n\nWill update this thread on updates and progress on this case let‚Äôs see if  get my money back or not. \n",

I have seen him many a times over the year and i am pretty sure many of you who follow techno might have seen him, he was last seen yesterday ( friday ) at indiranagar socials. I have seen him many a times in indiranagar socials itself.\n\nHe looks very similar to jazzie gift ( malayalam singer ), he is plus size, dark skin, in his 50s maybe, hair in his ears. He is about 5,5, wore a dark blue puffer jacket sleeveless with black tees under. \n\nAs i said, i have seen him in action many a times, but couldn't react before. His mode of operation is to go behind girls and try to cup a feel. He usually targets girls who are not in a big group ( and not with boys ).\n\nYesterday at indiranagar socials, i saw him behind a girl and decided to callout, i informed the girl that a creep is behind her, and she was very aware and was trying to move away from him. Rest of the party, i blocked him from going near her. I tried to get a picture of this guy, but couldn't.\n\nIf any of you see him again, please click a picture and report here, i can try to blacklist this guy from socials.\n\nI know it's tough for girls to react in this kind of situations and i have been there before in childhood. But please try to callout, the community in socials are super cool and they will help you.\n\n\nEdit :\nI am not a girl, all the efffin aholes and incels calling me a whore in my dms and asking me to take down the post, rot in hell. \n\nUpdate : Gotten touch with socials management team, they valued what i had to say, and said they will look into this. But i am not sure if they allow me to identify the man in cctv footages, unless there is law involved.\n\nUpdate : socials stopped answering my calls, i get their pov, unless law is involved they can't do shit, nor they can share his photo. Next best option is to wait until the event pics pop up on insta. This guy is super recognisable, he looks awfully similar to jazzie gift, and he is super regular in these events. Next time i hope i can take a pic of him. Just fyi, he is a smooth hardened creep who knows how to blend in even in his age and avoid bouncers.\n\nEdit : Here are some screenshots https://imgur.com/a/uXjvgma",

        "post": "I'm a 27-year-old woman, and today I took my daughter, who is almost 3 years old, to a newly opened mall in the southern part of Bangalore, which is close to our home. My daughter was having a great time on the rides in the play area. We had been on almost all of the rides she could sit on and were about to exit after getting on the last ride. I was filming her for a short while, cheering her on, when I stopped recording and just watched her as the ride was coming to an end.\n\nThat's when I noticed a man (whom I'll call P), who appeared to be in his mid-40s, standing just outside the play area. He was filming me and possibly my daughter as well. When I noticed him, my face must have changed to a surprised or concerned expression because P immediately backed off and moved to stand near the railing. I quickly lifted my daughter, feeling scared and unsure of what to do next. I continued to watch him closely.\n\nI realized that P was with another man, who appeared to be around the same age. I immediately called my husband (who was working from home) and also noticed that there was a security guard near the exit. I started walking toward the security personnel, and P noticed this. In response, he walked toward a section of the mall that was covered by a banner, where a new shop was under construction. This area was clearly not a place anyone would need to go unless they were trying to hide something. I was sure he was trying to delete the video before someone else saw it in his phone.\n\nI pointed P out to the security guard, and he went to confront him from behind the banner. P came out from there and started denied everything and showed us the gallery on his phone, claiming he was on a video call with his family on WhatsApp. The man who was with him then, joined and then Both P and the man with him kept insisting that P was talking to his family. \nI knew what I had seen, though‚Äîthere was no way he was talking to anyone. I tried to explain that I had seen him filming me, but by then, I was in tears, and I felt like I had already lost the case. I was also scared and didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I walked away.\n\nNow, I feel incredibly foolish for walking away and for not handling the situation differently. I‚Äôm overwhelmed with regret and self-doubt, and I keep thinking I should have done more to prove that he was indeed filming me. Here are the reasons why I am sure he wasn‚Äôt on a video call and was actually filming us:\n\nThe position he stood in: There was no reason for him to be standing right outside the play area, so close to the exit, if he were just talking to his family on a video call. He could have easily stood next to his friend at the railing and had his conversation there, away from the play area.\n\nHis lack of engagement: I observed him for more than a minute before I approached security. During this time, he was completely silent, with no lip movements or expressions, which made it clear that he wasn‚Äôt having a conversation with anyone.\n\nHis behavior near the banner: After I pointed him out to the security guard, he walked behind the banner of an under-construction shop, which made no sense unless he was trying to delete something from his phone, possibly to cover up his actions.\n\nHis phone‚Äôs gallery was already open: When he showed his phone to the security, the gallery was already opened, which seemed odd if he was truly on a video call. If he were talking to someone, why would his gallery be open?\n\nMy husband reached the mall, and we left soon after. I‚Äôm still shaken by the entire experience. I keep wondering what more I could have done to prevent this from happening or to prove my case. The security guard told me that they couldn‚Äôt find any proof on P‚Äôs phone, which was why they couldn‚Äôt take further action. Also ti is a new mall... There were very few people around than usually seen in malls and no one was even noticing such an incident happening...\nAnother older security guard even said that this wouldn‚Äôt have happened if a woman had been with P. This comment made no sense to me‚Äîwhy should his actions be excused because he wasn‚Äôt accompanied by a woman or would it mean he will refrain from doing such things only when he is with a woman... Makes no sense at all.... \n \nI feel so confused and frustrated.\n I‚Äôm left wondering how people around us can truly help and support us when something like this happens. \n\nWhat could I have done differently to prove that P was recording us and ensure he faced consequences for his actions? Is there something I missed in the moment? Could I have taken further steps to alert mall authorities about this incident? He seemed like a local, so if this is something he‚Äôs done before, I want to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen to anyone else. How can I prevent similar situations from occurring in the future, and what more can I do to hold him accountable?\n How can we, as women, ensure that we are supported in such situations and that those around us take our concerns seriously?",

        "post": "Hi everyone\n\nAs the title states, I wanted to ask about the Gruha Jyoti Yojana. I am currently a tenant living on rent in a subleased property (Kots, jic some might know about it). With this company, the setup is such that they calculate the electricity bill on their own based on BESCOM's calculation method and collect it with the rent. According to my understanding of the three circulars about this Scheme on BESCOM's website, there are no rules that state that I cannot apply for this Scheme. But according to the Kots staff these are the conditions for applying to this scheme:\n\n>If one wants to avail Karnataka Gruha Jyothi Scheme for 200 units of free electricity, both the below conditions must be true.\n\n>1. Registered voter id and adhaar card for current address before the scheme announcement.\n\n>2. One should have directly rented the apartment from a landlord who has a separate meter connection for you.\n\nI have repeatedly asked for a reference to this but they have not shared it. It looks to me like they have an issue with me applying for this scheme and do not want it to happen at any cost.\n\nOn the other hand, these are some related statements I extracted from the circulars:\n\n>The first circular states, \"This scheme is applicable only for household electricity connections; Not applicable if electricity is used for commercial purposes.\"\n\n>It also states, \"Under the Griha Jyoti scheme, a maximum consumption limit of 200 units per household per month in the state based on the monthly average consumption (based on the consumption of the financial year 2022-23) units of each consumer. Allow 10 percent higher power consumption limit, Accordingly, the cabinet has approved to provide the amount of electricity bill free of cost and to pay the full electricity bill for consumers who consume more than 200 units.\"\n\n>The second circular says: \"This scheme applies to all those houses which have a separate meter and meter reading is done.\"\n\nI had already applied for the scheme and my application has also gone through (still waiting to see if the electricity bill comes or not. It should not since my consumption is below 200 units and its a new flat with no past data either). I also have a separate meter. Also, I can see an option to pay for this meter through UPI apps that automate this payment.\n\n1. Does anybody know if what they are saying is correct or not? Am I eligible for the scheme or not?\n2. Does anybody know whether my application going through means I am eligible for this scheme?\n3. Finally, Kots mentioned, \"Even if your application goes through we are required to inform the BESCOM Dept. and get it reversed.\". Can they do that? If their reasoning is valid, then I have no concern, in fact, I'll get it reversed myself but if not, can taking this action be considered as infringing on my rights as a tenant?",

        "title": "Avoid Legal Traps: Lessons for Buyers and Investors from the Peenya Apartment Demolition Order",
        "post": "The recent demolition order by the Karnataka High Court regarding an apartment block in Peenya is a wake-up call for real estate investors and property buyers in Bengaluru. The court‚Äôs decision highlights critical issues surrounding illegal constructions, non-compliance with zoning laws, and deviations from approved plans. It also serves as a reminder of the legal and financial consequences buyers face when purchasing properties without due diligence.\n\n# What Happened in Peenya?\n\nThe Karnataka High Court directed the demolition of an entire apartment complex in Peenya after it was found that the construction violated zoning regulations and deviated significantly from the approved building plan. This judgment underscores the judiciary's commitment to upholding urban planning laws and ensuring compliance with building norms.\n\nUnfortunately, the real victims here are the apartment buyers, many of whom invested their life savings into these properties. The builders failed to adhere to legal norms, leaving buyers stranded with financial losses and legal troubles.\n\n# Key Takeaways for Buyers and Investors\n\n# 1. Importance of Property Verification\n\nBefore purchasing any property, conduct a thorough legal verification of the following:\n\n* **Land Title:** Ensure the property has a clear and marketable title.\n* **Building Approvals:** Verify that the construction adheres to sanctioned plans and has the required approvals from local authorities such as the BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) or BDA (Bangalore Development Authority).\n* **Zoning Compliance:** Check if the property adheres to the zoning regulations for the area.\n\n# 2. Beware of Builder Promises\n\nSome builders cut corners to maximize profits, often constructing beyond permitted limits or violating land-use policies. Buyers should always verify builder credentials and past projects to ensure they have a history of compliance.\n\n# 3. Legal Consequences of Deviations\n\nWhen builders deviate from approved plans or construct illegally, the consequences can be severe. As seen in this case, entire apartments may face demolition, leaving buyers with no legal recourse to recover their losses.\n\n# 4. The Role of Due Diligence\n\nBuyers must engage legal experts or property law professionals to audit the property. This step ensures that the property complies with all regulations and is free from legal encumbrances.\n\n# 5. Risks of Purchasing Under-Construction Properties\n\nUnder-construction properties often pose higher risks as buyers are reliant on future compliance by the builder. Insist on a RERA registration for such projects and regularly check updates on construction progress and approvals.\n\n# Tips to Protect Your Investment\n\n* **Hire Legal Professionals:** Engage a property law expert to verify all legal aspects, including the property‚Äôs history and current status.\n* **Insist on Documentation:** Ensure you obtain all necessary approvals, including Occupancy Certificates, Completion Certificates, and Khata Certificates.\n* **Avoid Illegal Constructions:** Stay away from properties with visible deviations, such as extra floors or irregular construction layouts.\n* **Verify Property Records:** Obtain an Encumbrance Certificate (EC) to confirm the property is free of legal disputes.\n* **Consult Experts for Title Searches:** Legal professionals can help uncover hidden liabilities, such as pending litigations or unregistered mortgages.\n\n# The Need for Stringent Regulations\n\nThe Peenya demolition case also emphasizes the need for stricter enforcement of urban planning regulations. Authorities must take proactive measures to inspect and penalize errant builders at the construction stage itself to prevent such devastating consequences for buyers.\n\n# Conclusion: Invest Smart, Stay Safe\n\nThe Peenya demolition order is a harsh reminder of the importance of legal due diligence when purchasing property. Whether you are an end-user or an investor, protecting your investment starts with making informed decisions and seeking professional guidance.",

I told him some of the problems I had when I took my car out, he made me recreate those problems in class and taught how to navigate them.

Fixing a road in should take around a month or two, I'm guessing? Especially if it is simultaneously fixed in multiple stretches.\n\nAnd given that a significant chunk of the traffic are basically corporate workers, I'm sure they would also welcome the decision and respect the effort made by the government.\n\nYou're welcome to poke holes in my stupid theory because I'm sure I've overlooked something lol",

        "title": "Beware Guys: My 2-Month-Old iPhone Got Stolen on Tin Factory Bus",
        "post": "My phone was stolen from a Tin Factory bus. It was a regular bus (Route No. 317) that I boarded from Baiyappanahalli Metro Station heading towards Tin Factory. I was returning from work, and someone stole it from the front pocket of my jeans as everyone was getting off at Tin Factory. I was aware that my phone was being slid out of my pocket, but by the time I reacted, it was gone. Within just 10-20 seconds, it was transferred from my pocket to the thief's. I was devastated and literally crying on the road.\n\n\nFull Story:  \n\nOn Tuesday, 26th November 2024, I was heading back from work to my PG. Normally, I take the metro (from Baiyappanahalli to Benniganahalli) and then board Bus No. 500D to Hebbal. However, that day, I decided to take the bus directly from Baiyappanahalli to Tin Factory.  \n\nWhen I boarded the bus, it wasn‚Äôt crowded, and I even managed to get a seat. However, at Benniganahalli, a large crowd boarded the bus, all heading to Tin Factory, and the area near the gate became extremely congested. As the bus neared Tin Factory, the man seated next to me asked me to give way as he needed to get down. Since I was also getting off there, I stood up and moved towards the gate, which was packed with people.  \n\nWhen the bus reached Tin Factory, the gate opened, and everyone started getting off. However, one man (whom I now suspect) in front of me stood still on the stairs, claiming his bag was stuck in the door and that he couldn‚Äôt get down. He stood there for about 30 seconds and asked the driver to close and reopen the gate so he could free his bag. During this commotion, my attention was diverted, and I became slightly irritated since he was blocking my way.  \n\nFinally, he managed to move, and I prepared to get off. But as I was stepping out of the bus, I felt a swipe in the front right pocket of my jeans where I had kept my phone. I immediately pressed my pocket, but the phone was already gone. I quickly turned around and shouted at the conductor to close the door. Instead of helping, he started shouting back at me because of the earlier delay caused by the man with the stuck bag.  \n\nAfter some argument, the conductor reluctantly handed me his phone. I dialed my number, but I couldn‚Äôt hear the ringtone amidst the chaos. I thought the thief might have muted the phone, so I called my girlfriend and asked her to keep ringing it through Find My phone (since it works even in silent mode). Meanwhile, 2-3 men standing behind me started misguiding me, claiming they could hear the sound coming from different directions. Trusting them, I searched where they pointed and even checked a few people‚Äôs pockets. However, these individuals were likely part of the gang.  \n\nOne man, in particular, grew aggressive and kept pushing me, shouting at me to check his pockets repeatedly. I now suspect he was the main culprit and had already passed the phone to another person, which is why he was so confident. Amid the chaos, I couldn‚Äôt think clearly or act logically.  \n\nIn about two minutes, the conductor opened the door, and people began leaving the bus. I was desperate and in tears but couldn‚Äôt do much. After most passengers got off, I stayed on the bus, hoping the phone might still be there. Unfortunately, my girlfriend later told me the location of the phone was showing Tin Factory, but I couldn‚Äôt communicate with her as I didn‚Äôt have my phone.  \n\nWhen the bus reached ITI Gate, I realized the phone was gone. I got off the bus and asked a few people nearby to lend me their phones, but most refused (likely fearing scams). Finally, a Telugu-speaking man gave me his phone. I dialed my number, but by then, 20 minutes had passed since the incident, and the thief had already removed my SIM card. The call went straight to voicemail.  \n\nI had enabled security settings to prevent the phone from being turned off without fingerprint verification, but these features only work in controlled environments. In reality, there‚Äôs little chance of recovering a stolen phone unless you‚Äôre extremely lucky. My girlfriend informed me that the last location update on Find My Phone was from Tin Factory, 10 minutes after the theft.  \n\nHeartbroken, I returned to my PG. From my laptop, I tried tracking the phone again through Find My Phone, but it showed the last update was over an hour ago at Tin Factory. That evening, I ordered a new phone and went to replace my Jio SIM card. My experience with Jio stores was also disappointing, as the first two locations I visited (listed on Jio‚Äôs website) didn‚Äôt actually exist. I eventually replaced the SIM at the Domlur Jio store.  \n\nThe next day, I filed a report at the local police station. The officer asked me to install the KSP app on my new phone and file a lost report. He also entered the phone‚Äôs IMEI number into a tracking system, saying they‚Äôd notify me if a SIM card was inserted into the phone. However, he admitted that recovery is rare.",

Did you know an NPS bus had fully tilted because of the roads? The bus had students in it. My anger comes from how difficult it is for my to commute to work. No one wants to take accountability, they just want to sit and say oh it is hard. No shit it‚Äôll be hard. Then they‚Äôll say oh do you know the paperwork that‚Äôs involved. \n\nJust be proactive.

        "post": "This literally happened to me literally just a couple hours ago(around 12am). I(20M. Bangalore resident for 4 years)had just got back from my native(Kerala). I got down at Silk Board Jn. I usually take an Uber but today I don't know why I was absent minded.\n\n A big dark dude came up to me and said he'll drop me at my location. I said it's fine I had already booked(I hadn't and he could see it). He said he won't charge extra and they have this government app that will show them the right fare. I was like screw it whatever and just got in his auto.  I told him the landmark of where I wanted to go(Mahadevapura area). He said it's fine. \"Mahadevapura only right? I know it.\" I got a bit doubtful with his reaction for some reason. We started off. I'm not fluent in Kannada and barely know a few words. So we spoke in Tamil. He understood and asked me what my language was. I told him and he started loudly playing some music of said language. \n\nI let my gaurd down a bit after this and thought \"maybe this dude is chill after all.\" A while later, conveniently somewhere near a not-so-lit area on the road, his auto started racing and he stopped the auto. He said some gear valve issue is there and his friend will be here soon with the wire or something. Alarm bells we're going off in my head at this point. He called someone and said he's standing in this particular area and bring the wire and come.\n\n I immediately started booking an Uber auto sitting in his vehicle. Now a small detail about me is that I'm 5'2ish and look like a bit like a kid. And I was carrying a heavy backpack and a suitcase.(I'm also very introverted and want to avoid conflict/confrontation as much as possible).So I was in a very compromising position all things considered. I got out and told him that I had booked another ride and that it was urgent and I had to go home. I said I'll pay him ‚Çπ50 for bringing me till here atleast(less than 3 kilometres). He said it's gonna be 100 and wouldn't take no for an answer. \n\nI was slowly starting to panic at this point so I said ok fine. I pulled out my gpay and to my luck my network was down. I pulled out my wallet and gave him a brand new ‚Çπ100 note. I turned around to pick up my suitcase and I heard a rip like paper tearing. I immediately looked back and he said this note is torn and that he won't take it. I told him then that I heard him tear the note and that I'm not an idiot. He said \"you gave me the note like this\".He started raising his voice slightly. By this time my auto has reached and is waiting for me(bless that man). I was getting very frustrated and scared now.\n\n He gave me back my note which clearly looked like it had been torn just then. I asked him if he had change for ‚Çπ200. He said he did. He pulled the note out. I showed him my ‚Çπ200 note and said this one doesn't have any tear. Take it and leave me alone. His friend has been on call with him the whole time. Just when I picked up my suitcase and started walking to my Uber, another auto pulled up with a few people in it. All local looking men. This auto guy started talking to him and said \"he started booking in the auto itself and it's here. He's leaving now.\" \n\nI got in the Uber and my auto driver asked me what was happening. I just told him to gun it, that it was a dangerous situation and that I'd tell him on the way. I told him what had happened in a panic which made mix Kannada,Tamil and Hindi in a broken jumbled mess. He told me to calm down and speak in Hindi. So I did. My phone's battery was at 3% which had added to my stress. We went ahead and we were travelling through Outer Ring Road. So the traffic at night due to the metro construction was insane. I calmed down finally and thought it's all over. \n\nAnother detail is that my parents are not in Bengaluru at the moment. They are out of station. So I'm completely alone. I let one of my friends know about the situation and sent him my live location. I then notice an auto pull up on my right. To my horrific realisation, it's the friend of the first auto driver. Him and his passenger we're both glaring at me. At this point I'm freaked out. Coz now I understood that they're following me home. My auto guy went ahead and I told him that those guys are friends of the other auto guy. \n\nHe told me understood and that's why he was speeding and gapping between vehicles with what limited space he had. And he did. I've never seen someone maneuver like this in my life. Man did everything in his power to lose the other auto and he somehow did.(I still kept looking back to see if they were following us all the way till I reached home).\n\n I finally reached home and my gpay was finally working. I paid him an extra ‚Çπ50 and thanked him a lot for helping me and now I'm sitting in my toilet taking a shit and typing this out peacefully. But I shudder to think what would've happened if didn't have the sense to book an Uber at the first sign of trouble. What would've happened if that other auto guy reached before my Uber?",

When I joined my company 4 months ago, it would take me an average of 1:45 to 1:50 hours to return home in the evening (I leave typically around 6). The only times when my travel time exceeded 2 hours was when it rained.   \n  \nOff late, the average travel time has gone up by 20-25 minutes. The entire section from the golf course to hebbal is choked. Hebbal is now a living nightmare. You as might as well declare the parts North of Hebbal to be a separate city. Even other parts North of Hebbal are getting worse. Bytarayanapura is fast becoming a silk board in itself (courtesy Mall of Asia). The airport road section after esteem mall is now regularly jammed. While earlier the days of sluggish traffic were an exception, they are the norm now.   \n  \nTo avoid the torture, I often take the Nice and outer ring road, but now the average time of the Goreguntepalya signal has also gone from 15min to 40min. I basically have to now pick my poison, because suffering is now inevitable. What scares me is that all of this happened within a span of just 4 months, the construction work notwithstanding (the number of cars has increased dramatically as well). With the way the city is expanding Northwards, I'm really worried about how much worse it can get, and how much more can the city take.   \n  \nAnyways, I'm now considering shifting closer to work. My honest opinion is that you either find a job that's hybrid/wfh or you shift closer to office because otherwise it isn't worth living in this city. \n\nps - before anyone blames me for being a contributor to traffic, I would like to say that I would gladly take public transport if there was decent connectivity. My decision to drive as opposed to shifting based on financial considerations. \n\n",

        "post": "Bangalore‚Äôs roads have become nothing short of a deathtrap. Specifically, the stretch from Silk Board towards Eco Space is absolutely horrendous! The service roads are filled with potholes so big, they could fit a 1BHK flat! And I‚Äôm not exaggerating. Stones and debris are scattered everywhere, making it downright life-threatening to even drive or ride through these roads. One wrong move, and it could be fatal.\n\nAnd the worst part? This is happening in a city where we pay some of the highest RTO charges in the country! Where does all that money even go? Certainly not into fixing our roads. It‚Äôs infuriating to see that despite paying through the nose for vehicle registration, basic infrastructure is non-existent.\n\nTraffic here is already unbearable. It takes hours just to cover 5-6 kilometers. And to top it all off, when they finally do attempt to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the roads, they just dump loose gravel into the potholes. There‚Äôs no actual repair work, no real effort to solve the problem. It‚Äôs clear the authorities know about this mess, but they just don‚Äôt care.\n\nThis is all a direct result of corruption in the BBMP and the utter negligence of our government. It‚Äôs mind-boggling how things can be this bad, and no one is held accountable.\n\nAt this point, it‚Äôs more than just frustrating ‚Äì it‚Äôs saddening. Every day, people struggle on these roads, just trying to go about their daily lives. Watching this unfold is not only infuriating, but it also makes you wonder if anything will ever change in this city. Is it too much to ask for basic infrastructure after paying so much in taxes and fees?\n\nWe deserve better.\n\nPs: sorry but not sorry but the long rant after a Wednesday office commute. \nYour regular IT guy.",

        "post": "Today is by far the worst day of my life. I woke up today and had a wonderful, positive day until I booked this auto from a metro station to go back home.\nThe station is located on a one-way road, and my home is on the other side, so I usually book from the other side of the road, which is approximately 200 meters from the station. It usually takes more than 10 minutes for any auto driver to accept the ride, so I book an Uber as soon as I get out of the station and start walking.\n\nToday, after walking for about 100 meters, the auto got booked, and the driver called me and asked where I was. I told him I was crossing the road and could see him. He started shouting at me, ‚ÄúWhy did you book it even before reaching the location?‚Äù I was in a good mood and answered him politely, but then he started abusing me (I‚Äôm a localite myself). He started saying, ‚ÄúEl idhyo, saaythiralla munche ne book maadi.‚Äù (Transl: \"Where the hell are you? Why the fuck would you guys book before coming to the location \")\n\nI told him, ‚ÄúSwalpa nodkond mathadi, bari 1 min aste. Waiting on maadi ast idre\" (Transl: \"Please mind your language, turn on the waiting charges if you want.‚Äù ) . \nThen he raised his voice to its full potential and started saying, ‚ÄúEll idyo gandu bega baa, direct aagi sigu. Ivath neen manage hogalla, maadthini ninge.‚Äù (Transl: Where the hell are you GANDU, you won't go home today, I will deal with you\") and he continued threatening me.\n\nI was completely broken hearing this. I got so scared. I literally thought about my entire life and my family and got terrified. \nI immediately canceled the ride and took an alternative way home. Even then, I was so scared he would appear somewhere along my way. I walked home completely shaking and sweating. I even complained to customer care, and they said they would never assign this driver to me again. That‚Äôs it.\n\nI have a demo tonight, and I‚Äôm not able to concentrate at all. This is all I can think think of. I‚Äôm completely lost. I'm literally shaking while I type this. \n\nI book these autos every day on Uber, Ola, and Namma Yatri, and this is the first time I‚Äôve ever experienced something like this. I can‚Äôt forget this my entire life. I used to tip these auto drivers an extra ‚Çπ5 to ‚Çπ10 every day, but I guess this is what I get for being nice. I have learned my lesson. These guys really deserve a place in hell. I don‚Äôt understand why big companies like Uber and Ola don‚Äôt do background checks on these goons before hiring them.\n\nMy cousin had a similar incident in Mumbai, and she went to the cops and sorted things out with them. I‚Äôm not sure the cops would even consider these things seriously here.\n\nI was always defending my city and country so much, but today I finally understood what outsiders go through when they meet these goons. It's not just Bengaluru these goondas are wide spread through out the country. God save India. üôèüèª\n\n\nAuto driver name: \"Vijayakumar\"\n\nAuto number : \"KA 01 AN 2281\"\n",

This was around the time I was born and for the first 2 years of my life, I suffered from a large number of diseases and was constantly sick due to my poor immunity. It was at this time that Surabhi went for a pilgrimage and returned back with a Sai Baba shawl and gave it to my mom and asked her to put it under my bed. And then the incident happened. Till today, my parents haven't removed the shawl from under my bed and it remains untouched as a memory of her. It's quite a sad situation since I'd read about the fires but did not know my personal connection to someone who lost their life as a result of the fire. My mom talked about how she was always smart and quick and how after her death my mom saw a video of her jumping and it just really sucks. Just thought I'd mention it.",

They have one of the toughest jobs out there‚Äîdelivering in all weather conditions while being pressured to meet unreasonable delivery times. \n\nThe bigger question is:\n- Are these apps putting both riders and civilians at risk with poorly thought-out service offerings?\n- Are we, as customers, to blame for chasing convenience without considering the pitfalls?\n\nIt feels like this system is setting everyone up for failure‚Äîand someone will eventually pay the price. What do you think?",

        "post": "25M, Bangalore resident for 2 years. Encountered only one rowdy auto incident until tonight‚Äîthe second one. Lucky, compared to the stories I hear.\n\n11 PM - Booked a Rapido cab from Central College to Hoodi. Fare shown: ‚Çπ385. The driver had a 2.6 rating (red flag), but it was raining, and he was nearby, so I took the ride. Uneventful journey, apart from the uncomfortable Indica, but manageable.\n\nAt the drop, the driver claimed the fare was ‚Çπ600, showing a screenshot from - what I understood after 60 seconds - a previous ride. My app showed the trip to be still in progress, and there were no route deviations or stops. I understood his scam but chose not to confront him.\n\nHe gave excuses like ‚Äúserver takes time to update‚Äù and suggested checking my email, gambling on me not doing so. No end-trip email arrived. He asked me to call Rapido, but they only had an SOS option since the trip was technically still ongoing. By then, he had logged out of his original account and into another one, showing me an empty ride history for the day (saying that the server takes time to update). A couple of taps on his phone confirmed the history was entirely blank‚Äîclear proof it wasn‚Äôt the original account.\n\nStill, I didn‚Äôt confront him. I played along, telling him I‚Äôd pay whatever fare was shown in my app, even if it was ‚Çπ1,000. I checked everything he asked‚Äîlogged in and out, connected to home WiFi, and even called Rapido SOS (terrible service, by the way). Finally, I said I‚Äôd pay ‚Çπ385 now and GPay the rest once the app updated. He began getting rowdy and insisted he needed the full amount immediately for his subscription renewal, but I sympathized, cursed the ‚Äúserver issue,‚Äù and assured him I'd pay the rest later‚Äîafter all, he knew my address.\n\nAs he started getting rowdy, my reverse-UNO of sympathy worked. Having waited 20‚Äì25 minutes and realizing the scam wasn‚Äôt working, he reluctantly accepted ‚Çπ385 and left. Moments later, my app updated (i.e - he ended the trip) confirming the original fare: ‚Çπ385.\n\nLow-key proud of how I handled the situation. If I‚Äôd been rushing to work, or had a flight, I wouldn‚Äôt have had time for this, but I‚Äôm happy I managed to de-escalate gracefully without directly confronting his scam. Small victory. üòä",

        "post": "So, I live in Bengaluru for about 8 years, and, in the past few years, I have seen a lot of progress. One example is the rapid replacement of small local shops with international brands such as KFC and McDonalds. Even the streets in my area are increasingly becoming cleaner, with roadside rubble being replaced by walkable sidewalks. This progress, as far as I can tell, is not just in my area, and happening all over the city, and the city is becoming more and more modernized as time goes on, with the city becoming much more clean (except for the fringe areas). So, the next logical step would be for Bangalore to build skyscrapers and large malls and markets to increase tourism, as singapore did, but I do not see that happening. Why is this?\n\n  \nEDIT: BY THE CORPORATIONS REPLACING SMALL BUSINESSES I MEANT THE GUTKHA TOBACCO SELLERS, NOT THE ACTUAL VEGETABLE VENDORS?",

        "title": "Our city roads & streets are very filthy but I feel just a handful of things cause 80% of the filth. But no one really talks about them",
        "post": "Firstly yes, there is no denying that civic sense of the mass majority of Indians is really low and the education, intent to keep things clean in public is just not there. People litter, don‚Äôt care etc. But these things are always talked about for years and decades. So I am not in denial mode about this. Also there is corruption that everyone talks about. All there. \n\nHowever, I‚Äôve been to multiple cities in this state, country and around the world. And I couldn‚Äôt help but observe some patterns when it comes to cleanliness in the cities of our country and especially Bengaluru as I‚Äôve lived here for the longest. Have you observed how things are 100x more cleaner in Army cantonment roads, Tech Parks and inside gated villa communities? So aren‚Äôt Indians living/using them as well?\n\nJumping into the list of the causes of filth that no one seems to be talking about: \n\n1. Construction sites:\nHuge huge culprit. These houses/buildings when being built absolutely follow no rules or norms whatsoever. The sand, gravel, bricks are mostly always stored and spread across the road and completely destroy everything around. \n\n2. Lorries and trucks in construction: \nConnected to point 1. These trucks and lorries transporting the sand, mud, bricks, cement, etc travel in a way that litters all the roads everywhere as if it all belongs to them. Well actually it does as it‚Äôs all owned by land mafia and politicians and anyone who fears for their life dare question these thugs. \n\n3. Cows: They are everywhere yes and people do talk about it. But Holy hell do they poop. And their poop is all over the place. And when they do it is huuuge and disgusting! Not obviously blaming the poor souls but again these are owned by some people who again don‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs behind about cleanliness. \n\n4. Wind and Rains:\nWild entry this one. Many of you will be surprised to see this and may find it ludicrous to blame nature. But here‚Äôs the thing. I‚Äôve seen it n number of times where the trash was actually stored somewhere neatly or it‚Äôs limited to a small corner somewhere but strong winds/rains carry them all around the city. Now there is wind and rains in other clean countries too obviously lol but this obviously happens here as there is no code or rules or awareness by civic authorities and people alike in storing/piling rubbish. Having it closed/contained properly? Who cares, who knows!\nNow imagine when a flood happens and all that is nicely transported all across cities clogging the drains and causing even more flooding with a cocktail of disgust!\n\n5. Street vendors:\nYes, I know they are just making a living, we need to support them yada yada. But do they litter? Hell yeah they do. Not all but a lot of them. Enough to litter the streets and public places. Coconuts, plastic straws, vegetables and their leaves, and what not. People who sell juices/chats with no trash storage so people throw the plates, spoons and glasses where exactly? Yeah on the surface of our motherland. Again no issues with those who have the sense of cleanliness and responsibility. \n\n6. Delivery agents: \nAnother surprise entry. But hear me out. I‚Äôve seen a lot of them throw away extra bags, plastic containers that are not needed right on the road. Like for instance someone orders groceries, the items are handed over to the resident, the guy takes the bag and simply throws it on the road. \n\n7. Shops and restaurants: Yes and yes. Even if they are neat refer to point 4. Pavements and footpaths are often completely taken over and destroyed by them. Shops especially and these again have political connections and police protection through hafta so who the eff cares. \n\n8. Road side curbs: What are these? A well finished road will have the road connecting to the footpath in a proper manner with drainage. When that does not happen the gravel and the rubble sand all contribute very well to the dust bowls that our cities have become. \n\n9. Tobacco consumers: Yeah ok. These are very often talked about. That Ill admit. But they very much belong on this list because they are huge culprits of the filth. Not just spit- yuck! But the litter too. Notice the litter- it‚Äôs all vimal, rajnigandha, cigarette and beedis and it‚Äôs not just zubaan but the entire roads are kesari. Yuck, yuck and yuck. \n\n10. Road construction and repairs:\nAgain a huge contributor to our mess and filth. The people responsible for maintaining them. The so called authorities. They dig up roads for cables, water repairs and what not and just leave it like that because again- Who the eff cares. \n\nThere you have it. Any more? \n\nSo who‚Äôs going to fix this? We blame Govt, Govt blames us. Meanwhile the rest of the world keeps looking way better. Even the lesser developed and other developing nations I‚Äôve been to look cleaner. The cities that is. Are we going to remain like this forever? ",

Here's my experience:\n\nFor the past few months, the ride price they show has become incomplete. The \"tip\" has become mandatory if you actually want a rider to accept your booking. Without adding a tip (which is often 20-30% of the actual ride cost), you'll struggle to find a ride at all.\n\nThe ironic part? They don't include this mandatory \"tip\" in the invoice. The invoice only shows the base ride price, making the \"tip\" completely untraceable in official records.\n\nThis means:\n\nYou can't claim the full ride cost for tax deductions.\n\nIf you're reimbursing through your employer, you'll only get the base amount. The \"tip\" is on you!\n\n\nEssentially, what they're calling a \"tip\" is no longer optional; it's a hidden cost they're forcing on riders. It's frustrating because you're paying extra, but there's no proper record for it.\n\nThis feels like an unethical way to increase prices while keeping the ride fare \"officially\" low.

We were a group of 15 people and we closed meetup group after the 15 people as this was fairly new to us and we did not wanted to host a very big event.\n\nAlthough the experience was good, we started by strolling mg road and then having a quick bite at easybites and then went to the entertainment store in mg road.\n\nI am not gonna go into every little detail of the day, but to sum it up‚Äîby evening, we headed to Pegs n Bottles for drinks. As the night wound down and we were getting ready to settle the bill.\n\nOne guy literally ghosted us. He said he was heading to the washroom and just disappeared, leaving the bill behind (honestly, that's on me for not seeing that coming). \n\nOn top of that, another guy was making things awkward by trying to sit way too close to one of my female friends, despite her clearly expressing she was uncomfortable. We had to step in and ask him to leave the group. Thankfully, the rest of the evening went smoothly. \n\nAfter the whole ordeal, we came up with a set of ground rules that could be helpful for you too‚Äîfeel free to add anything that might make the experience safer and more enjoyable for everyone.\n\n1. Setting a minimum Karma limit to make sure no spam account or a banned account for whatever reasons is joining. \n\n2. No tagging along with friends apart from the people in the group. No +1s or anything of that sort.\n\n3. No alcohol or expensive cafes should be included in the trip due to the frequency of scams that happen around the city, occasional smoking stops can be made. \n\n4. Minimum age is 18+ as the rest of you might get in trouble if the parents yell for going out with strangers,\n\n5. Only travel in daylight and return before night and only in public places for the safety of everyone.\n\n6. for any payments above 150/- per person everyone will have to pay the vendor individually to decrease the potential of getting scammed.\n\n7. Encourage participants to use their Reddit usernames rather than their real names if they feel more comfortable. It's also wise to allow people to opt-out of group photos to maintain privacy.\n\n8. After the meetup everyone can give rating to everyone anonymously through forum to organise future meetups according to group dynamics.\n\nFeel free to add any more points you think will be helpful or something I missed.\n\nHope this helps, Peace out ‚òÆÔ∏è\n\n",

        "post": "Just here to rant about the DL test I recently gave in Bangalore at the electronic city RTO which has the ADTT (automated driver's track test)\n\nSo, storytime: Couple of months ago I signed up for driving classes from *Maruti Driving School, Mondovi*.(The instructors were pretty great but the practical classes felt too short) After the 20 classes I straight applied for DL, again through them and started practicing. Which largely involved forcing my dad and bf to teach me + let me drive.\n\n>Cut to the eve of the DL test<\n\nI'm sitting and watching YT videos of road signs, parallel parking tricks, scrolling through RTO stories and posts on reddit, and generally freaking out about my clutch skills on a slope.\n\nBut, all in all was super excited to give the test and hear the words \"pass aithu\" (I'm 29 and lately I've been dying for some thrill in life, some sense of accomplishment)\n\n>Now cut to the day of DL test<\n\nI dragged my dad along, spent 500 bucks to get to the e-city RTO. Waited for 3 hours in a queue for some registration. Waited an hour more to do the test. (Almost felt like some entrace exam)\n\nAnnnnnnddd finally when I got my turn to drive. The frigging instructor dude asks me to get in, push the seat back, and says HANDS OFF THE STEERING WHEEL AND HE CONTINUES DRIVING.\n\nHe did the entire test. Didn't let me touch the wheel or the peddles :/\n\nSuper annoyed that it was sucha joke. Getting my DL felt so underwhelming and the RTO stole my chance at a sense of accomplishment as an adult.\n\nAnd they just let me pass chumma???????????? WHAT A JOKE. \n\nTLDR: Passed my DL test with flying colours because I didn't drive. The RTO people drive you around the track. The whole thing is a joke.\n\nEdit: \n1. Some money deets: MDS fee: 7k and DL registration through MDS: 1800 to 2100\n2. RTO dude's reasoning to hijack the test: the sensors are too sensitive and even a minute mis-step can cause a 30min delay. And given the crowd - it would be chaos for the RTO. Hence all driving school instructors do the tests themselves, apparently",

I took care of the pups as much I could many died due to road accidents, drowning in the gutter etc. \n\nNot a single dog was neutered in that area. I called the south zone BBMP neutering service provider and informed them about the situation. \n\nThe dog catchers came and I showed them where to find the dogs. The dogs were caught, neutered, vaccinated and dropped off after 3-4 days. Eventually over a period of one year all the dogs were neutered. Sometimes I used to lure the hard-to-catch dogs into my house compound one night before they arrived so they can catch them next morning. \n\nNo new puppies were born and the aggression was reduced too. \n\nThis is a request for people of Bangalore to communicate with the number below based on your Zone and try to get the dogs in your street or area neutered. \n\n1. EAST - SHAIK MASTAAN 9032959895\n\n2. WEST - AKSHAY B - 7676916113\n\n3. SOUTH- AKSHAY B- 7676916113\n\n4. RR NAGAR\t- Smt. RADHA AMARNATH - 9900136382- 7022461019\n\n5. DASARAHALLI- DR.

The BBMP takes care of all the costs. This is one of the compassionate ways to decrease the stray dog population and it has worked tremendously well in some areas of Bangalore. \n",

Despite many companies in India moving towards more flexible work arrangements, this firm refuses to allow work from home to its Indian employees, which is both outdated and inconvenient. The irony is that the same firm's employees in other countries are asked to work from home! feels like they have no regard for Indian employees' comfort or work-life balance, insisting on a rigid in-office schedule even when remote work is a proven option.\n\nThe compensation is far below industry standards, which makes it hard to feel valued or motivated. And after going through a tedious and unnecessaily long interview process, the disappointing salary offer just adds insult to injury. One of the biggest frustrations is the firm's insistence on forcing employees to come in on weekends for \"social events\" and photoshoots. These activities feel more like a forced PR exercise than genuine team-building, and it's frustrating to see management disregard employees' personal time. But perhaps the worst part is the rampant favoritism within the company. Employees who shamelessly bootlick the management are rewarded with better treatment, perks, promotions and even work from home, while hard-working individuals who simply focus on their jobs are often overlooked and underappreciated. The culture here is toxic, and merit seems to take a backseat to office politics.\n\nHonestly, this place failed to meet even the most basic expectations of a supportive and fair work environment.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

Do I need to share all the list of my monetary/other assets with my family in advance? Or is there a service or a way to let them know of it later?\n\n3. Typically,  what is the cost of a funeral in Bangalore? As morbid as it sounds, is there a way to pay for it in advance? Or set aside the amount in the will to ensure quick access of the same to my family?\n\n4. Do I need to have a power of attorney (or whatever is the term for the person who makes pulling the plug decisions) ? What's the process to get this formally created? Does the person declared as such also need to sign the document for it?\n\n5. In case of any foul play: does this increase the time required to complete the process from death to the actual funeral?\n\n6. If I specify in the will that I wouldn't want to feed a fuckton of my relatives etc, is that something that most Hindu families are likely to respect?\n\n7.

My post was not a comparison between Gurgaon and Bangalore‚Äîit was a comparison between two areas within Bangalore. Nowhere in my post or in the comments was Gurgaon mentioned, yet they spun my words into a misleading narrative for clicks.\n\nSimilarly, *News18* published an article titled \"[Bengaluru Is Overrated, People Are Rude‚Äô: Haryana Woman After Living In Tech Capital For Four Years](https://www.news18.com/viral/bengaluru-is-overrated-people-are-rude-haryana-woman-after-living-in-tech-capital-for-four-years-9131049.html).\" This article not only cherry-picked negative aspects of my post but also ignored the context. I never generalized the entire city. My criticisms were specifically about issues I faced while living in East Bangalore (Varthur), but the article unfairly paints my words as a condemnation of all of Bangalore.\n\nIt‚Äôs disheartening to see media outlets sensationalizing Reddit posts and misrepresenting stories solely to drive engagement. The media, often regarded as the fourth pillar of democracy, seems to have lost its purpose when it resorts to such practices.\n\nI urge these outlets to stop defaming cities and hurting people‚Äôs sentiments for the sake of clicks.

To this, he was a little sceptical, which made me further sceptical. Now his friend who had the cash took out his cash and started counting now. Obviously, another thing was that he was double counting a few notes and just to show that they had full amount cash, he demonstrated that they had the cash, but at that point, even double counting was in the red flag that I was noting. Whether because that flag, how tightly he was holding the bunch of notes. Then I pretended that I believed his counting and yes, he has the money and placed my hand in front of him to get the money. Then he said the payment has to be reflected first and then only he can give the cash blah blah blah blah bullshit. At that point, I was fully convinced that I should move out of it.

And saying this, I moved on. They were there abusing me and saying whatever nonsense. \n\n\nBut the thing that this is so alarming is that they were doing it in sync like multiple people more than three at least at different signals and potentially scaling their fraud. Secondly, the other thing was that only one of the three had the said cash, but still, three people were active with the same story. This suggests that they are now prone to this lifestyle of fraud and are now down to their last few cash. And are in desperate need. Now, once when they have tasted the greed of acquiring money without any hard work. This will just further push them into darkness and will make them do something that are difficult to even imagine. \n\nJust wanted to let a community know that something like this might be widespread in other regions also. And while discussing this incident with my friends, I came to know about a similar fraud. Where in this case, they were just wanting to get money, paid via PhonePe, and had no intention to give the cash. But in other versions, they did actually give the cash, but the QR code was bugged and more than necessary information of the account was revealed to the fraudsters. And money more than the cash, they gave was withdrawn from the account. There are multiple different versions of this. So maybe you are a kind person and wanting to help, but in these times, instead of helping others, first think about yourself. ",

While we were in a clothing store, a boy, probably around 8-10 years old, approached my son and asked him to play (speaking fluent English). At first, I didn‚Äôt think much of it and was okay with the interaction, but things took a turn when the boy suggested they leave the store to play outside in walkways while we continued shopping. That immediately set off alarm bells in my mind, and I became very alert, keeping a close eye on them.\n\nThankfully, my son refused to go outside and stayed by our side, but the boy wouldn‚Äôt leave him alone. He kept insisting they go play outside and even tried to lure my son by showing off a red car. At this point, I decided to intervene and started asking the boy questions like his name and where his parents were. Instead of answering, he avoided my questions and began playing hide and seek. He eventually left my son alone for a short while but returned a few minutes later and started bullying him.\n\nAt this point, I had had enough. I asked a store employee about the boy, and shortly afterward, I noticed the boy going up to a young couple (probably in their early 20s) who were behaving strangely, pretending to shop. We finished our purchases and decided to leave the mall.\n\nBangalore residents, have you experienced something similar? Am I overthinking this, or is there cause for concern here?",

Bommanhalli to begur, Haralur road, hosa road feels like a village from 25 years back. Don't people pay property taxes, road taxes and Property registration charges which should go into maintaining cleaning these roads. It's almost like no one cares. As a common person how does it matter if BJP or congress is in power what matters is you deserve basic cleaning, road maintenance as before. It's like Bengaluru is growing new things while forgetting the old one's.\n\nWhat are your views and how it can be solved practically, is there a forum where we can collectively raise concern, may be the root level people responsible are not doing their job? Or they are overburdened. Not sure. \n\nEdit 1: Builders who are selling flats upwards of 1.5 cr for 2 BHK have a say too right? They are planning huge townships in an area where there is lack of even basic road maintenance and cleaning Why can't they demand some sort of answers/accountability (Classic example Varthur).

        "post": "Everybody who reads Kannada news dailies and watches any prime-time news channels may have observed this growing trend where more and more English is being used in Kannada Newspapers and the TV media is even worse they are directly using English script for few of their headlines and breaking news. The news anchors and panelists suddenly break into English as if it somehow makes their point more valid. Numbers and dates are as a rule only in English even in the newspapers dates, and other statistical numbers are in English and the names of foreign athletes in the sports section are barbarized when written in Kannada, whereas they can actually be written properly in Kannada easily. Is this because working in a Kannada newspaper or media doesn't pay much and actually talented people aren't joining these organisation for work or is it simply gross negligence?\n\nThis is truly sad, because if this continues in a generation or two Kannada number system usage might reduce drastically to the point of dying out in the written form, like Malayalam numerical system in the written form has died (one of my mallu friends told me they use Hindi numerals for written form). I'm a Bengalurean born and bred but till date I think and count in Kannada, this too is vanishing.\n\nAlso in the Vidhana Soudha especially in Vidhana Sabhe (Legislative Assembly, MLAs house) I've observed many legislators quoting statistics and reports of the GoK in English when simpler versions are available in Kannada, same goes for Media and Newspapers when there are simple and complex Kannada words and phrases available, why do these people use English so extensively, especially when they are the ones who are supposed to uphold and enhance Kannada. \n\nDon't get me wrong, using words like Computer, TV, Calculator and other recent inventions is fine, as words like Ganakayantra aren't even Kannada in the first place it's Sanskrit, but many words and phrases like Probably, mostly, mainly, most importantly, unique, aeroplanes, President, Prime Minister of the country, welcome and many more are seamlessly used during prime-time news hours discussions, even recorded news presentations have started using many English words. \n\nIs this ok or acceptable, are Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Odia, and other languages facing this issue? \n\nI write in Kannada, write in the sense I have written a few poems and short stories and I want to write Novels and publish a collection of my poems later on, but I don't see anyone in my circles being creative with Kannada, they can write academic articles and such, but poems, stories, satire, allegory, travel diaries are all mainly done in English, even though many of my older relatives read Kannada works extensively but ig they don't have the time to write and people in my generation don't even read Kannada as much especially in Bengaluru, I have written many articles, poems, essays, and stories in English, more than in Kannada but I have written considerably in Kannada too and personally I feel more attached and connected to my Kannada works. When I read my poems to family members and friends who are Kannadigas they resonate with it and feel it more compared to works of other languages but friends especially don't actively read Kannada apart from a handful of them. \n\nThis is why I feel we haven't won a Jnanapeetha prashasti in such a long time and Hindi has overtaken us in the number of awardees in a single language (yes by virtue of more speakers, but that didn't hinder the prospects of our previous generations).\n\nI truly am worried that Kannada might be losing its relevance in popular culture within Karnataka itself and is very slowly albeit steadily being reduced to a spoken language, movies nowadays do count but they can't be regarded as the Jewels or timeless masterpieces of our language say like Ramayana Darshanam, Mookajjiya Kanasugalu, Chikaveera Rajendra and other brilliant works by hundreds and thousands of Kannada poets of the past 200 years and countless before that, which truly churned the language and produced gems as a testament to the beauty and richness of Kannada language itself.",

        "post": "I just joined Reddit few days ago and this is my very first post - I am originally from Haryana. I spent my childhood in Gurgaon, pursued my education in Mumbai, and completed my master‚Äôs and worked in the US. I moved to Bangalore four years ago and initially lived in Varthur. During that time, I fell in love with a localite who was my colleague. We got married, and six months ago, I moved to his house in Padmanabhanagar.\n\nDuring my stay in Varthur, I often felt that Bangalore was overrated. Although it is marketed as a tech hub, my experience was limited to its proximity to the tech park. The area lacked proper roads, infrastructure, amenities, and‚Äîmost importantly for me‚Äîculture. It felt non-existent. People were rude, disconnected from each other, and the place resembled a lifeless concrete jungle‚Äîmore like a concrete immigrant asylum.\n\nFast forward to today, I now live in Padmanabhanagar, which is probably deep in the heart of Bengaluru towards south west. It‚Äôs a place where someone like me, a \"North\" techie would least expect to venture, because there is no point living there unless you are a localite, tech parks are far away from that place, but I shifted to complete WFH now.\n\nI was shocked and baffled by this place. The infrastructure is top-notch‚Äîthough not quite like the US, it is far above the standards of a typical Indian city. There are beautiful parks, trees that almost touch the streets, and no water issues, all the footpaths and roads are very well maintained, though there are few potholes here and there (this is probably the de-facto standard of India). It is on par with the posh areas of Mumbai that I used to visit during my college days.\n\nMore importantly, I want to talk about the people. They are completely different from those in Varthur. I initially thought my inability to speak Kannada would be a problem here, but guess what‚Äîalmost everyone knows English, and I didn‚Äôt face any issues at all. The South Indian culture we often see on TV or read about in books is very much alive here. My husband was born and bought up here, so he knows the entire block we live in and he has introduced me already to everyone lol.  The people here seem educated and come from well-to-do families, they are culturally rooted - yet they seem progressive. Many of their children are pursuing master‚Äôs degrees in the US or working in some tech companies or non-tech in Bangalore. I was pleasantly surprised by how accepting they are. For example, I would wear short clothes while going for a walk, and unlike in Varthur, nobody stared at me angrily.\n\nThe temples here are also incredibly beautiful. There are several popular places nearby, like the Banashankari 2nd Stage market complex, Gandhi Bazaar, and Basavanagudi.\n\nI‚Äôm amazed at how different the cultures and vibes can be within the same city. When I lived in Varthur, I never imagined Bangalore could be so beautiful and welcoming. Now that I‚Äôm here, I feel incredibly lucky, and I don‚Äôt ever want to leave this place. I want to explore the city more and more.",

Two  observations and interactions gave me following the info. I was having golagappe, this stall has both golagappe and momos, so the kid was requesting a fellow customer to buy him momos as he was hungry (apparently) and the customer was kind enough to ask the momo vendor to give him a plate, the child particular about having chicken momos. After the customer left, I enquired the vendor and he told me that it was the child‚Äôs 6th plate that evening alone and he does this everyday . And as it is still good business for the vendor he doesn‚Äôt reveal the truth. \n15 mins later I walked into the city supermarket 5 buildings across and there I found the same child being given a 5kg bag of rice and some . Since I had just found out the momo scam, I asked the billing staff for more info and he told  that this again is a repeated scenario and he takes at least one bag of 5kg rice everyday. On further enquiry , because obviously a family of 4-6 would require a maximum of 1 kg per day, he told me that they bring the extra bags and sell it back to the supermarket for half the price in cash . \nI believe this to be genuine as I‚Äôm a frequent customer of both the places and I‚Äôm acquainted to both the vendors and staff and I trust them enough to tell me the truth about these . \n\n\nThese kids are often seen doing this in front of pubs and eateries mostly to women and men who are with women . They do not go to a group of men. \n\nAfter knowing the truth I have observed many more such instances and I realised the pattern and have now decided never to entertain such children. \n\nBegging is fine, being charitable is fine.

But on the bright side, Bagheera has become the first Kannada movie to make it to the platform. A vigilante-based movie in Kannada is such a rare treat for us!!!\n\nWhat‚Äôs frustrating is the lack of hype around Bagheera. If this same story had been made in another language, I feel like it could‚Äôve been a national hit. People who watched it in theatres, including reviewers had mostly good things to say. Despite that, the movie only ran for a few weeks. It‚Äôs annoying when people complain about Kannada movies having ‚Äúno proper story‚Äù or ‚Äúmediocre performances‚Äù but don‚Äôt bother to support films like this in theatres.\n\nPersonally, I loved Bagheera. The first half had me on the edge of my seat and the second half was solid too. After Ugramm, this is one of Sriimurali‚Äôs movies that I genuinely enjoyed.\n\nI once again watched Bagheera today on Netflix. I missed the full theatre experience but it was still really good. I really hope more good Kannada movies make it to platforms like this. There‚Äôs so much amazing content in our industry that deserves a bigger audience.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share my thoughts. I‚Äôm not trying to promote anything, just expressing how I feel.

But what he did after that shocked me. \n\nHe started punching the dog badly - on its jaw and back while holding its mouth close with one hand. I could hear it whimpering in pain. \n\nI went up to him and politely asked him to stop and he immediately started with some maa-behen gaalis in Kannada. Then he noticed his actions were getting quite some attention so he dragged his dog like this for nearly 100metres (this is when I filmed him)\n\nI called the police in and shared details with the operator. They told me a cop would call me back soon. He had walked away by then. \n\nI didn‚Äôt mean to follow him but my vehicle was parked on a road near his house. I saw him enter a house and he saw me. He walked up to me aggressively and again started abusing me. \n\n‚ÄúEe ooralli irra bekaa illva?‚Äù (Don‚Äôt u want to stay in the town?)\n\nAnd started threatening me , using intimidating body language and obscene gestures (miming lowering his pants suggestively )\n\nI was worried for my safety so I said ‚ÄúNannge bera kelsa idhe. Jagada maadakke ella time illa. Naav hogthini‚Äù ( I have other work. No time to fight. I‚Äôm going)\n\nAnd he was all like ‚Äúaah hogu. Hogu ri.‚Äù And other stuff which I don‚Äôt remember cos I was getting overwhelmed. \n\nWhen I finally did get a call back from the police, 30 minutes had lapsed and I had reached home. Spoke to the cop, shared the video and the house address on WhatsApp and he told me that he would visit that man and give a warning. (I don‚Äôt know for sure if the cop actually paid that abuser a visit or just said it.) Also said that I could call him (the cop) directly if the man harassed me in any other way. \n\nI thought that was the end of it and was occupied with other things throughout the day to revisit that incident. But now it‚Äôs night. Everyone‚Äôs asleep. The house is quiet. And it‚Äôs my prime overthinking time.  My mind still has not gotten over the fear / trauma I felt when confronted by that abuser. \n\nI  frequent that road multiple times daily (but it was my first time seeing that abuser) I‚Äôm shit scared. I‚Äôm losing sleep over the possibility that dog abuser might figure out it was me and lay in wait for me to exact revenge :  rape me at gunpoint / round up fellow goons to harass me / kill me / throw acid on me - my brain is buzzing with all these scenarios and I can‚Äôt sleep a wink! \n\nI mean if he got so worked up when I politely intervened‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no telling what he will do to someone who called the cops on him. \n\nAnd while I do appreciate how responsive / concerned the cop seemed, I can‚Äôt ignore the fact that it took nearly an hour for the police to act on it (30 mins for call back and 30 mins for the police to reach that place). Anything could happen in an hour‚Ä¶.\n\nI am going to buy a pepper spray and pray that nothing untoward happens - because we all know that our country, despite all its greatness, isn‚Äôt the best at meting out timely justice ! \n\nI‚Äôm also gonna try to get the details of the owner of that abuser resides in to hopefully get him evicted. \n\nI also called the PETA hotline but was directed to leave a voice message and informed that I would receive a call back (nothing yet). \n\nIf anybody‚Äôs faced a similar situation before or has some advice, I would appreciate it. \n\nThanks.",

I gave her lift and dropped at the location she asked me to, which was on my way home, she was happy and thankful. I continued going home and after sometime, about 1.5 km from home, my scooty stopped. I tried self starting it and kick starting it but it didn‚Äôt start, must be some sensor or spark plug problem. There was no mechanic near by, the nearest mechanic was near my home which was 1.5 kms away. I tried booking Rapido, auto but since it was peak office timing (6:30 pm), I was not getting one. I tried getting lift from strangers who were on bike, by showing the thumbs up üëç lift symbol and none of them stopped. Literally more than 30 bikes passed by and every single one of them just looked at me asking for lift and just passed by. Finally I got a bus and went home. \n\nI felt a bit bad that in this city life, nobody is ready to help strangers. I felt dejected when I literally helped someone with same thing few minutes ago but I was not getting help for the same. I was okay since it was not an emergency, but it got me thinking would anybody be willing to help someone in emergency? Or would they just pass by like they did to me today?",

The driver was Sanjay and when called his name showed as Mohammed Rizwan. I asked him and he said his name hasn't been updated on Truecaller kind of apps yet. I sat down and almost after driving for a Kilometer I asked him to switch on the AC since I have Dust allergy.\n\nHe said He won't switch on the AC since it is a Mini Cab (it was a Celerio).  If I need AC, I should have booked Prime Sedan. I asked him to stop the car and cancel the ride and he said he can't stop the car and once ride is on, it can't be cancelled midway. Then I told him to drive to the nearest police station but on the way neither I saw a traffic constable nor a police station.\n\nAs I was getting late to work, asked him to close the glass in the windows and I switched on the AC myself and it worked very well. I then immediately called Ola Emergency helpline (the call got connected to a Human Being after10 minutes). \n\nThe Ola staff told me to go in the cab and that the driver won't get a next ride unless his AC is repaired. He  then kept me on hold and called the driver twice (Driver saw the incoming call but didn't respond). The Ola staff told me the same. I told him it's all happening in front of my eyes, then I put my phone on Speaker and the Ola staff spoke with the driver. Then the driver was extremely polite and told the Ola staff that his AC sensor is damaged and AC doesn't cool. \n\nI got baked and got down at 1:15 PM today and ended up paying Rs. 616/- too. \n\nDoes the Government do anything? Does Ola do anything? How much is/does the Police help?\n\nThe alternative isn't another cab aggregator. \n\nIt's just law enforcement and conducting surprise quality checks by Ola that's needed for a comfortable, hassle free and safe ride. \n\nQuestion is: Who will bell the Cat?

        "post": "TL;DR - If you can't speak Kannada, that's okay. Being a jerk about it isn't.\n\nI've been meaning to write this for close to five years now but didn't say much because I wanted to spend more time in Bengaluru and see how things go before forming an opinion. Given that I'm originally from Rajasthan, and lived in Mumbai for many years, I never considered myself a \"northie\", even though that would be an easier interpretation for many localites. At present, I've been spending time in Bali, Indonesia. As I kid and teen, I've lived in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Dubai, and few places in the EU. \n\nAfter all these experiences, Bengaluru is one of the few cities that hold up well in my opinion. If India has a good chance at growing as a cultural hub, this place is it. Of course, I'm buttering you guys up, can't afford to get kicked out yet. \n\nJokes aside (or not), Bengaluru has been nothing but sweet, comforting, and welcoming to me all these years. I've lived here for so long, I consider this place to be my *home* while a lot of people around me who are from Mumbai have a hard time adjusting. I was never harassed or threatened in any way or form because of the so-called \"language barrier\". I also happen to be man/male/marrd, so that's a luxury. \n\nHowever, this also became a problem at some point, because this city set very high expectations of what a multicultural hub should feel like. All my local friends here happily converse in English (my preferred language) or Hindi with me, and share popular Kannada sayings, songs, poetry, and related works of art. \n\nKannada as a language is so beautiful and complex, to this day it baffles me how \"complicated\" it could feel to a person who isn't from Karnataka or places around. In fact, I learned phrases in Bahasa (Indonesian) quicker than I could ever get a grasp on Kannada. Again, something like Duolingo certainly helps! I seriously hope Kannada arrives on the app soon.\n\nNow, here's my major observation. I don't think most localites have a problem with someone not being able to understand or speak Kannada. What they don't like is a lack of empathy, kindness, and an overall imposition of Hindi. While I don't believe any language or way of life should be imposed on anyone, I do think having \"one\" language for all would be a nice thing. I guess that's why English works in most cases. \n\nIn my experience, any time I don't understand something in Kannada, I just give a smile, and explain how I don't speak the language. The other person is more than happy to help me out. On the contrary, I've noticed Hindi-speaking folk trying to use the classic, \"*why don't you speak Hindi?!\"* card which isn't helping anyone. Since I'm not the biggest humanity, it does fill my tiny heart with pride to admire Bangaloreans as some of the kindest souls I've met. Non-two-faced empathy is a rarity in India, so this does make me happy. \n\nThat's something I've been actively learning from the Balinese people. Bali is host to people coming in from different places across the globe, and the locals here never force anyone to do/learn anything. The result? A lot of foreigners (including my girlfriend, who's originally from Germany) learn the language on their own and respect the local ways.\n\nFin.",

Here‚Äôs how it unfolded.\n\n‚ÄúEyy, yeshtu hothu madtya? bega ba!‚Äù (Hey, how long are you taking? Come fast!).\n\nThe other guard shot back ‚Äì ‚ÄúIru, tinta idde, bartini‚Äù (wait, I was having food, I will come)\n\n‚ÄúTinta idre, illi kelsa yaar madtare?‚Äù (If you are away having food, who will work here?)\n\n‚ÄúKelsa madode oota madakke‚Äù (I work so that I can put food on my table). Mic drop.\n\nScene 2\n\nI raced through the stairs to reach the platform, only to find that the metro had just left. The next one was after 4 minutes, so I kept my bag aside and waited, huffing and puffing.\n\nA woman walked up the stairs and stood beside me. A lady guarding the platform noticed her, seemingly an acquaintance, and initiated a conversation ‚Äì ‚Äúesht hour duty?‚Äù (How many hours of duty?), she asked.\n\n‚Äú12-13 hour-u, night 10 gante tanka‚Äù (12-13 hours, till 10 o‚Äôclock in the night), the other women replied.\n\n‚ÄúAshthotha!? Maklu idara?‚Äù (That long hours!? Do you have any kids?), asked the disconcerted lady.\n\n‚ÄúIbru chik maklu idare, athe-maava nodkotare‚Äù (I have two small kids, my in-laws look after them), she explained.\n\nBy this time, the train appeared in the distance, everyone proceeded to board. I looked at the two women, they both nodded at each other and went on with their day.",

When I'm fasting, it doesn't give me hives.

        "post": "A year ago, I moved from NCR to Bangalore for work. Before I came here, I‚Äôd often heard people say things like, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt speak Kannada, locals will harass you.‚Äù Honestly, it made me a bit cautious, especially after a few tough interactions with auto drivers in my first few months.\n\nBut something changed yesterday. I took an auto home from work, and the driver started talking about the roads being ripped apart and left unfixed for months. We got chatting, and after a while, he asked me if I spoke Kannada. Now, I could‚Äôve brushed it off with an attitude like, ‚ÄúWhy should I speak Kannada?‚Äù‚Äîbut instead, I smiled and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt speak Kannada, but I sing it sometimes on Instagram.‚Äù\n\nHis face lit up. He seemed genuinely happy and even asked for my Instagram ID! By the end of the ride, it didn‚Äôt matter to him whether I spoke Kannada or not‚Äîwhat mattered was that we connected through mutual respect and curiosity.\n\nThis experience made me realize that so much of our interaction with people depends on how we approach the situation. If I had reacted defensively or with ego, the conversation could‚Äôve easily turned sour. Instead, we found common ground and ended up spreading some positivity.\n\nSo, to everyone who‚Äôs moved here or plans to: it‚Äôs not always about where you‚Äôre from or what language you speak, but about how open and respectful you are to the people around you. Spread love, not hate‚Äîsometimes, it‚Äôs just about choosing to sing a different tune.",

        "post": "We aren't entirely aware of the context, but we were coming back from dinner, in Block 7, about 10.30 pm, and a guy was standing between two traffic lanes by a pedestrian barrier. Both of his bags were on the ground, and he looked obviously confused.\n\nMy group of friends, and some other people managed to get him to the sidewalk, and we started asking what happened. He either got hit by a car, or an auto driver punched him and knocked him down where he hit his head on some concrete.\n\nThe guy didn't know what day it was, couldn't give a straight answer as to where his destination was, and kept asking the same questions, & repeating the same statements. It was obvious he had a concussion. Although my current First Aid registration is expired, I have had one for a total of 8 years off and on.\n\nHe was defensive (another symptom), insisting he was fine (symptom), and could make it on his own. A friend took his phone and called a family member, but he insisted on walking off by himself--he absolutely could not walk a straight line. We followed him for 45 minutes trying to get him into an auto to take him someplace a family member could meet him, but it was a struggle because he continued insisting he wasn't injured.\n\nFinally, we pushed him into an auto, had his family member talk to the auto driver, and left it at that.\n\nI'm American, and back home the protocol would have been to call an ambulance, and that would have been the end of it. I wasn't clear why the group didn't want to call an ambulance, but sure, this is a different culture.\n\nIt wasn't just my group of friends that stopped to help. One guy gave him water, another guy cleaned the wound on his temple. Probably 8-9 people at the beginning all worried about his safety. That was good to see.\n\nOverall, a challenging situation because this guy was a classic case of someone with a concussion insisting he was fine when clearly he wasn't.\n\nIf you can manage it, I'd recommend anyone interested, take a certified First Aid course. I was the only one who knew what the signs of a concussion were, and was insisting this guy had one. It's not as simple as assuming, \"He must be hurt, but I can't say specifically why, or how I know for sure.\" It's important to know the signs, and what to ask the victim to do: \"What day is it? What's your name? Where are you going? What's your phone number? Close your eyes, and touch your nose. Stand on one leg,\" Shine a light into their eyes to check for pupil dilation etc.\n\nAnother thing that wasn't quite the way I wish it was, was someone in the group acting as leader and giving orders about what other people should do. People easily get their defensives up when they relinquish power to others, and take orders, so I understand why it didn't happen, but this is an important thing to do when there is an emergency.\n\nI have been here 18 days, and I am having a really good time (except the air is much worse here than back in my home state). I have already made a good group of friends.",

        "post": "This post is for people who call Bangalore their home, people who are born and brought up in this city (not outskirts I.e. IT).\n\nWe lived our childhood/adulthood in independent houses in Bangalore where we used to play on the road or empty sites or fields nearby. We used to visit all our neighborhood houses as kids for Ganesha chaturthi, sankranti etc. Most of our houses were built by our parents, occasionally grandparents, who were not in IT. Many of them didn't have money to hire any contractors etc and built the houses on their own along with labourers. These are mostly middle class families. The requirements were different back then and hence skillsets and professions varied a lot as well. So our houses also were not in IT belt, but now, all their kids, i.e. us, are in IT and have to travel 1.5hrs to work. \n\nAs adults now, in your 20s, 30s, 40s, how are you guys managing/plan to manage housing ? Are you living with your parents ? (In the houses you grew up in) Which is completely ok. Or you bought site and built your own house and parents optionally move with you. Even with this how are you managing travel to office ? Only recently, with covid, a lot has changed and companies are more open to wfh. Will it last forever ? Even for days you have to go to office are you just coping with the travel ? \n\nA lot of us don't desire to live in an apartment. I would hate to live on a 10th floor of an apartment where you open your door you would see a long hallway with doors facing each other. I agree for most an independent house would be your ideal house. We weren't gifted any site/house from our parents nor our parents can be considered rich to lend us a lot of money. But we still wish to have a house of our own. For those who did achieve it, I.e. bought a site and constructed your house, how did you do it ?\n\nThe current prices are 1Cr+ for a 30x40 site in the outskirts of the city and you still have to end up travelling 1hr+ to work. Are you guys able to find sites within the city ? If so, is it affordable with your own money (not parents) ? Or are you ok with asking/discussing these with your parents ? \nOr did you guys move to the IT belt ? How are you guys able to afford this ? Single income families, how are you able to achieve this ?\n\nMoving to the IT belt also would be a very difficult option because the lifestyle there is not suitable for us.\n\nI want to hear from each and everyone of you. Please do respond. ",

It hit me that this part of Bangalore which is mostly in IT sector pay great taxes, generate most revenues, spend most overfilling the unbelievable amount of pubs in this area & order infinite food circulating money in local Bangalore ecosystem. Yet, the civic infra is not present. \n\nBecause this part does NOT vote. Literally 70% of this area is in Goa during election weekend. Why would anyone care? \n\nThe politicians are in cahoots with builders, they make a bank, they run the pubs, they again make the bank, and they know they don't have to care as they don't vote. \n\nHave you seen the Kengeri satelite project? That was Sarjapur once. They even got parks and all planned. Because people care, I guess? They vote. \n\nHarlur road has 20 premium societies with 12 feet road. There are broader road in Malleshwaram with duplex lining either side. \n\nThe IT corridor has become a stupid doormat because they don't belong here or there. And, it's their own doing. \n\nLiterally, it should have gotten a metro way before anyone but here we are.",

The arrested suspect is Ravikumar, a resident of Yalachenahalli, who worked as a carpenter.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if a son like you lives or dies\", Ravikumar said, as per the FIR, before assaulting Tejas which led to severe internal injuries. The Kumaraswamy Layout police have invoked BNS Sections 103 (murder) and 238 (causing disappearance of evidence).\n\nSenior police officers said that Ravikumar was allegedly angry with Tejas, 14, as he lagged in studies, hung out a lot with his friends and used mobile phone frequently.\n\nAccording to the police, at around 8 am on Friday, after an argument, Ravikumar, who was reportedly drunk, hit Tejas, a Class 9 student, twice on his back and then on his limbs with a cricket bat lying in the house and smashed his head on the wall. Tejas collapsed on the ground.\n\nShashikala B, Tejas‚Äô mother and the complainant, left the house thinking it was a daily ordeal. Tejas had an older sibling who was away at the time.\n\n‚ÄúThe previous night, after dinner, Tejas fought with me demanding to repair his mobile phone,‚Äù Shashikala told the police as per the FIR. ‚ÄúI told him that if he went to school I would have it looked at. Even my husband told him to not spoil his life. Despite this, Tejas hit me and abused me. I then went and sat near a temple.‚Äù\n\nShashikala returned the following morning only to find her husband and son quarrelling. After going to the temple again following the assault, she returned in the afternoon only to see Tejas breathing difficulty. ‚ÄúHis friend Kishore was at our house. Both of us took Tejas to the hospital at around 3 pm, where he was declared dead,‚Äù she told the police.\n\nShe also alleged that Ravikumar, when he learned about Tejas‚Äô death, had disposed of the cricket bat that he used during the fatal assault and tried to cover up.\n\nLate in the afternoon, the Kumaraswamy Layout police received an alert that a young boy had died and his parents were preparing the last rites.\n\n‚ÄúA team was immediately dispatched. They intervened and when they found out about the incident, secured Ravikumar,‚Äù a senior police officer said. ‚ÄúHe was produced before the court on Saturday and remanded in judicial custody.‚Äù",

May be these are not the problems for others. Help me to find the solutions if you have any\n\n1. It's challenging to identify the right bus on time since Google search result is not reliable always. Last week, the bus timing was showing 2.37PM whereas it came before 2.15 PM. Thankfully, I was there early, else I would have missed.\n2. Another problem is that there is no website or app that has the data of direct buses for a particular location. Example, I am unable to find the list of direct buses from Electronic City bus stop to Mahadevpura location. There are some direct buses, but the numbers are limited, and Google search doesn't show it always.\n3. The problem with Google search is, it shows the bus timing of recent timing. There is no way to check the past and future timing. For example, If I want to know if tomorrow 1PM any bus is running, there is no way to check. There are websites, but the information is not organized. \n4. One more problem I am facing is getting the route details properly even the official site has a lot of flaws and need improvement.\n5. The last one is getting the route details in an organized for a particular bus. Example, 342-F. If I search, there are lots of results but none of them are organized in a way that would help.\n\nComment your problems. Who knows may be BMTC will see and try to fix these issues.",

He then continued filling it again while another attender was asking me questions about my Credit Card. They then stopped filling at 1200Rs.

They managed to get me thoroughly  confused by the end of this ordeal. \n\n  \nAfter exiting the pump, I checked the updated range readings in my car and I was certain that I just got scammed. The google reviews of the place shows that it is EXTREMELY common with a lot of people having given negative reviews regarding the same.\n\n  \nAnyone have any idea on how I can report this anonymously?

Commuting in this area is such a headache, taking minimum 40 minutes to travel just 3 kms. After facing the traffic woes, I decided to walk everyday to office situated in Sarjapur road 3 kms from home, and that was even worse. Though I reached office much faster, it is nothing short of an adventure. Pedestrian footpaths just don't exist here, and if they exist, they are used by the two-wheelers or occupied by the vendors or parking vehicles. In many places, footpaths are broken having open drains underneath. Sometimes pedestrians don't have a way ahead as the whole road is occupied by vehicles and there is no space to walk. These swiggy zomato guys also always ride their yulus like they are gonna run over you. And on top of that had to cross through the dust flying all around in the air, vehicle smoke, a open dumpyard right on the middle of the road and the stinking Kaikondrahalli lake. This area also gets inundated whenever it rains for more than 30 mins. Rents in this area are also sky high. A normal 2 bhk costs you around 30k, and if you need some luxury like society then it goes more than 45k.\n\nOne of the most unplanned areas of Bangalore, real estate mafia ruined this place.

So their claim is healthy gourmet meals with a lot of focus on protein and vegetables so I ordered an egg and mushroom sandwich which I loved I thought the veggies in it were great. BUT the spaghetti on the other hand was so bad and so was the bread that came with it. I‚Äôve ordered from them multiple times and I would only order their sandwiches from now after trying their spaghetti and macaroni. I also really like their over night oats but it is a bit pricey and that‚Äôs my only complaint\n2. Salad days I ordered the mushroom and cottage cheese sandwich and the falafel salad. Both tasted delicious. Felt very organic and wholesome. Lots of veggies and good ingredients. I would definitely buy from here again. I personally felt that the price point was great too as I got both for a total of 500 or so. \n\nThis is just a mini review! Do let me know if you guys liked it or would like more info. Or if there are places you recommend that I should try and review next! :) ",

This is a devastating thing as this amount is equivalent to his 3 years salary and he took so many personal loans to facilitate this money.\n\nScam details in detail\n1. They make you do sone tasks and actually credit amount, they credited 1k first\n2. Made him download a fake trading app (devnet.cc something not sure) and gave trade calls to make money\n2. Made him send 5k and made him trade and actually deposited 7.5k to his bank as withdrawal \n3. My bro believed this is true as they had a group of 2k members and sent screenshots of everyone and the trade account is real they even sent agreement which is ofc fake that if they take any loss the company will bear it\n4. Then they asked him to deposit more and more and each time his trading account got updated with more money but not able to withdraw \n5. For withdrawal they asked more money then only withdraw possible since my bro invested a lot he wants it all back so he kept doing this\n6. When I got to know I made him stop IMMEDIATELY \n\nNext Actions\n\nI know the money is gone and it was all about emotional toll and sleepless night. I contacted Bangalore batman - @stbrospeh sorry for wrong id many people know him here\n\nHe IMMEDIATELY told to file the complaint i did it from my end yesterday night and today morning i got a message that 1k has been put on hold, I uploaded all 30 transaction details. Oh yea they made him send to all various upi id,imps and all more than 30 accounts they all termed it as merchants.\n\nComing back, I saw this and againasked batman about it, then I directly called 1930 they were very very quick and they refilled everything as in my complaint for some reason only 1k was saved. That did again in 1hr they were on call only.\nI got another message that 36k is on hold now.\nI have no more hopes of recovery as they would have emptied all accounts.\n\nJust so you know if you raise a complaint and the receiver has the same amount they freeze it.\n\nI STRESS YOU anyone goes through anything like this DAIL 1930 works or not do it IMMEDIATELY as possible.\n\nCyber crime is LEGIT they will try, ofc I‚Äôll update  if anything more happens.\n\nMy bro has realised his mistake what‚Äôs done can‚Äôt change, We will get through this ultimately he‚Äôs my brother and I‚Äôll not let him suffer this pain for a long time I‚Äôll do what I can.\n\nThanks for your time, I really needed to let it out and ensure no one else gets into such traps.

He said his friends called him \"Friendly Manja\" because his motto was, \"A friend in need is a friend indeed.\" I smiled politely, but his cheerfulness felt slightly off.\n\nAs we sped through the traffic, he chatted non-stop about the weather, traffic jams, and rising pollution. Then, about ten minutes in, he glanced nervously at the fuel gauge.\n\n‚ÄúSir, the fuel is almost out, and I don‚Äôt have any money. Can you help?‚Äù\n\nI hesitated; it seemed like a ploy. He seemed sincere, and his motto was oddly reassuring. ‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù I said, pulling out my wallet. ‚ÄúJust make it quick.‚Äù\n\nWe pulled into a fuel station off the main road. My mind was racing. Was I being scammed? But as I watched the fuel meter tick up, it seemed legitimate enough. While they were filling the tank, my phone buzzed.\n\nIt was Dinesh, my boss. People in the office call him \"Deadline Dinesh\" because he sets strict deadlines. He shouted, ‚ÄúWhere are you? Get here fast‚Äîimportant work, tight deadline!‚Äù\n\nThe call ended abruptly, and I hurried Manja along. He nodded, picked up the pace, and soon, we reached my office. I rushed inside and started working.\n\nIn the afternoon, I reached for my phone and realized I had left it in Manja‚Äôs auto. I panicked. There was no way to trace or contact him. By evening, I decided to visit the police the next day to file a report.\n\nThe next morning, as I stood outside the office with Dinesh, sipping tea, he was praising my quick work under the tight deadline, but I barely heard him. All I could think about was my phone, filled with personal information, contacts, and photos. I was about to ask for time off to file a police report when something unexpected happened.\n\nThe rumbling sound of an auto caught my ear. In the distance, Manja slowly appeared. My heart raced. As he got closer, I saw something in his hand‚Äîmy phone. He stopped his auto, smiled, and handed it to me, saying, ‚ÄúA friend in need is a friend indeed.‚Äù\n\nThis is a reminder that there are many friendly auto drivers out there.",

Maybe charge a small premium for the convenience.¬†\n\nBut today a casual stroll through Madiwala market was a huge surprise to me\n\nI couldn‚Äôt believe I was paying more than 100% of the market price for onions, green chillies and lemon. Almost all the vegetables which I buy regularly were being sold at upwards of 40% premium.  On top of this they charge delivery fees and all the absurd convenience fees \n\nThis is ridiculous. With inflation at a 15 month high, frequent visits to your local market can go a long way in protecting and growing your savings.¬†\n\nMy analysis in comments as imgur link.",

In my half-asleep state, I left my AirPods behind without realizing it. The next day, when I needed them, I couldn‚Äôt find them anywhere. I opened the ‚ÄúFind My‚Äù app, and sure enough, the AirPods‚Äô last location near my phone was in my Apartment cab drop point and current location was airport car parking area, hence I dropped them in the cab.\n\nSo, I reached out to Uber support, got the driver‚Äôs number, and called him up. He instantly denied having the AirPods, saying, ‚ÄúI give so many rides‚Äîsomeone else probably picked them up.‚Äù He even got aggressive and abusive, especially after my friend called in Kannada to help me explain. At that point, I knew he was hiding something. He started dodging our calls and ignored our texts, but I wasn‚Äôt about to let it slide. We took the matter to the local police station.\n\nThe moment I explained it, the officers knew the drill. One officer called the driver directly, told him they knew he had the AirPods, and warned him about the consequences of lying. The driver caved immediately, saying he‚Äôd bring them over. But then he called me, insisting I meet him somewhere else, he cannot come to Police-station, he asked me to come to my home and deliver, he also seemed to have someone along with him when he called me. Not taking any chances, I shared a location near my gym instead, and a few of my gym bros came along for backup.\n\nThe driver showed up, visibly shaken seeing people along, and handed over my AirPods without asking for the payment he‚Äôd been demanding earlier. The guy who was abusive and rowdy initially was all polite, good boy now. But to keep it fair, I paid him the fare he‚Äôd likely spent getting there since it had all started with my own mistake.\n\nShoutout to the Namma Police for stepping in, Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúFind My‚Äù app for tracking those AirPods, and my gym bros for having my back.\n\n[findmy app screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/WQbBfIo)",

With all ambiguity over green card, visa etc,  ageing parents and bay area culture ( all conversations revolve around where we work, what we work etc), I am thinking of moving to Bengaluru. I was born and bought up in Bengaluru and my parents and spouses parents also currently live there. Bought a flat (paid off) in Varthur  and thought of coming back permanently.\n\nWhile trying to figure out various other things, one thing which I am keen to know about is how is work culture in India, especially in top product companies. It's not that great tbh in US too. I constantly work more than 50 hours per week, have unreasonable deadlines etc. So was wondering apart from long working workings , what would additionaly be different in India. Also are long working hours a constant factor in all companies in India ?  I am planning to initially internally switch to Microsoft Bengaluru as Senior SDE\n\nAlso do people who have lived in different country for couple of years feel very uncomfortable with corruption in Bengaluru ? (I have heard that the scope has reduced as more and more things are digitalized). I am also not a trekking or outdoor person, I mostly enjoy malls or shopping places where I just roam without even buying anything. Would this be possible near Varthur ? Would people like neighbors etc generally talk, I am trying to understand socializing part. Here in bay area (or US) it is very formal and very hard to make meaningful connections or friends.\n\nI currently have a paid off flat (so no rent), have some investments (plots). I honestly don't have much drive to make lot of money , I just want peace. Keeping this in mind, how much should we generally save before retiring in Bengaluru (assuming I work till 50).",

This is probably the most localised part of bangalore where Kannada rules the roost. \n* South Bangalore\n   * Essentially what Bangalore means to me.\n   *  Jayanagar, Basavangudi etc.  is all about wide tree lined roads mainly residential. JP Nagar 3rd phase and beyond (Kanakapura Road, Bannerghatta Road) is a bit densely packed with mixed native and non-native residents.\n   * All Indiranagar pubs are opening up branches in JP Nagar- so future pub/restaurant capital? But also the best South Indian food in town ( these Malleshwaram folks will fight this)\n* East Bangalore - To do justice to this I have to split this section up\n   * East blr (Indiranagar, Domlur etc) - Peak young bangalore- premium residential area with a strong ass RWA - hip destination with the best of shopping and dining and just has a very cool vibe to the space. \n   * Far East Blr (Whitefield, Marathalli etc) Yikes man- I have not felt more alien than this part of Bangalore- the whole vibe is totally different- its hotter, dustier and just totally off character IMO.  and man. the. t.r.a.f.f.ic. is just something else- how does one take 1 hour to get 2-3 kms and thats normal?? \n    * but credit where it‚Äôs due- they have some good restaurants and premium shopping. When it comes to residential- premium communities. Shit hits the fan when you step outside though üòÇ\n* Central Blr- \n   * Mostly CBD (Central Business District)  and cantonment residential areas with Anglo-Indian crowds (Ulsoor, Cooke Town, Cox Town) some parts like Kamanahalli have declared themselves a republic of their own xD\n   * Enjoyable - very Bangalore- they have access to every part of town. \n   *  Mixed demographic. \n\n  \nWhat's y'alls take on this? Where do you live? and what do you think about it? If this picks up I'll edit and go on adding the most popular opinions for each part.

Why didn't it make headlines before 2 months ?\n2. Why is waqf claiming the lands all of a sudden ?\n3. Many historical lands have been in controversy from 2005 , like the famous Bidar fort, why is it making headlines after 2 decades ?\n4. Why is JDS and BJP, not taking the matter to court of law , when they are confident about it ?\n5. Will the controversy still be alive after the elections?\n6. What's the Home ministry doing about it ? \n7. Waqf claiming lands are making headlines in Tamilnadu, Kerala and Karnataka, why doesn't it make headlines in BJP ruled states ?\n8. Why is BJP's diaper baby , with the help of fake news channel Republic TV, is spreading fake news in Twitter ?\n\nAt the end , the BJP will never stop waqf board's licence, if they wanted they could do in the last decade. Why are they still afraid of making actions ? They need a topic to speak and tell the country, Hindus are in Danger. \n\nOn the other hand, the Congress won't bring in laws to stop them , fearing losing their vote bank \n\nI believe the whole controversy is Election gimmick and will die out after the assembly re-elections is done and will re-suffer sooner in the next elections.",

We‚Äôre still shaken up, and I think it‚Äôs important to talk about situations like this to raise awareness and remind people to be cautious.\n\nSo it was me, a guy friend, and two girls, and we were just walking to a nearby restaurant, chatting and minding our own business. Out of nowhere, a man, who looked clearly drunk, came running up behind us. At first, we thought he was just a random person in a hurry, so we slowed down to let him pass. But instead, he slowed down with us, staying uncomfortably close.\n\nWithout any warning, he said ‚ÄúAao bhayya‚Äù to my friend, which put us all on edge. The two girls in our group felt so uncomfortable that they crossed to the other side of the road. The man continued to follow us, talking loudly on his phone, and using vulgar language that was clearly directed at the girls. We were trying to ignore him, but he stuck right with us, not letting up.\n\nWhen we finally reached the restaurant, we hoped he‚Äôd leave us alone. Instead, he came right up to us and started asking weird questions about the girls, like whether they were our ‚Äúsisters or wives.‚Äù His tone and behavior were really unsettling. He then asked what language we spoke, and since neither of us guys know much Kannada, we told him we mostly spoke Malayalam, hoping he‚Äôd lose interest. But this only seemed to make him angrier.\n\nAt one point, he started claiming to be a ‚Äúrowdy‚Äù and even threatened to ‚Äúshoot us‚Äù if we didn‚Äôt cooperate. This freaked us out, but we stayed calm, not wanting to make things worse. He even offered to buy food for me and my friend, which felt like an attempt to control the situation rather than a friendly gesture. We refused politely, hoping he‚Äôd finally leave us alone.\n\nLuckily, some people nearby noticed something was wrong and came over to see if we were okay. We quickly explained what was happening, and they spoke to him in Kannada. What he said next was even more shocking‚Äîhe told them he wanted some sort of ‚Äúadjustment‚Äù with the girls, as if that was a normal thing to ask. Hearing this, the people advised us to leave quietly, giving us a chance to escape while they dealt with him.\n\nWe quickly headed to a nearby supermarket, hoping to get away from him for good. But as we were walking through the aisles, trying to calm down, we noticed him entering the supermarket too. At that point, we were genuinely scared, so we left and rushed back to our apartment as fast as we could, not looking back.\n\n",

They said that the parent are at their farm which is outside the city but we cannot meet the parents we can do a video call. However, when I requested to do a video call, they seemed to evade the question. When I questioned more, the breeder got defensive saying ‚ÄúDo the puppies look tortured to you?‚Äù. I was just really put off. Haven‚Äôt had a follow up call from them.\n\nThe other one seemed better in the sense there was a big place for the puppies to run around and we met the parents. However the puppies were really unkempt, which is understandable considering it‚Äôs really hard to find good people to take care of dogs. However, the breeder wasn‚Äôt available, so we just saw the puppies. I haven‚Äôt ruled out this one, because he comes recommended by 2 other people. ¬†\n\nHow do I find KCI registered breeders? Or if anyone has any recommendations, it would be great. I‚Äôve read a few articles that mention we should observe the parents. TBH the ones we are talking to, just say that they will do a video call with the parents.\n\nP.S I know adopting an Indie is better, but this dog is going to be a companion for my mother who is currently recovering from a severe depressive state. Of course she has help with me and others, but she is the primary carer, so at this point we want to a small and a predictable dog. Hopefully in a few years time she is ready for another dog and will definitely consider adoption.¬†",

        "post": "One of my friends introduced me to their partner today (they are running some kind of business). The reason for the introduction was that they are going through an expansion and looking for potential partners.\n\nThey set up a meeting at Chaayos, Park Square Mall. First, a person came to meet me‚Äîher partner‚Äîand explained that the senior partner, a lady, would come to meet me to see if I have the vision and mindset for the business and if I‚Äôm like-minded enough to partner.\n\nThe lady boss came for a general introduction. She didn‚Äôt say much about herself and insisted on getting to know me better. She asked why I wanted to do business. My plain answer was to make money and take on challenges to learn and gain confidence in life. She responded by saying that you can find challenges anywhere, and I insisted on not missing the monetary benefits. She asked why I hadn‚Äôt started earlier, and I said I didn‚Äôt have a clear idea to start with and didn‚Äôt want to go into commodities since my job is paying well in that case. Then she talked about the mindset of Zepto‚Äôs founders, a food delivery app, and how they succeeded even after dropping out. I called her out, saying she was wrong, and corrected her by saying Zepto is a food delivery app. She responded by saying this is not a debate and that she just wanted to convey the mindset aspect.\n\nI asked about the business, and she said I wouldn‚Äôt be able to fully understand it. Then she explained that they are in B2B e-commerce. They would set up my virtual distributor shop, and I would get distributorship rights for big corporations, selling to retailers. I would have 10-14% margins shared with all the partners. They work in collaboration, so if any other partner makes a sale, I get my share. I would receive lifetime royalties from things sold via my virtual shop.\n\nThere are two requirements: I have to make a quick decision and invest 4.5 lakhs. That 4.5 lakhs would be used to secure rights in my name and start my virtual shop.\n\nI asked follow-up questions, and she said she couldn‚Äôt tell me more about the business. Once I say yes and share my documents for verification, she would tell me more, and I would need to have the money ready. She said that once I get into the business, I would fully understand it.\n\nI asked if I wanted to know more, is there a website or something I could read on. She said no, we are protected, and there is nothing on the internet. I asked her to send me at least some documents to read, and she said she had already told me everything required. She said I need to make my decision and have the money ready, and once I‚Äôm in the business, I would understand it fully. She added that if it were on the internet or so public, everyone would be doing this. We are exclusive and protected.\n\nI had a heated discussion, and she left, asking me to make the decision and inform my friends. Then my friend told me this is not the way to talk to a senior partner. I said that as a partner, we need to know each other and the business well. I can‚Äôt understand anything without being inside the business, she said. \n\nThis friend is more of an acquaintance, and I don‚Äôt know a lot about her. How we met is an interesting story, but it doesn‚Äôt add any context here.\n\nThe job requires 2-3 hours a day, done digitally. That friend bought a car recently and quit her full-time job as well.\n\nSounds like an MLM scheme or scam to me. But is there anyone here who has come across this or been part of it? What is this business, how does it operate? Is it legitimate?\n\nI said no to join because I can‚Äôt be part of anything I don‚Äôt fully understand, and it‚Äôs not public or on the internet‚Äîanything protected and very private is a red flag for me, and I can‚Äôt put the money in it blindly.\n\nOne more thing, they kept calling each other sir/ma‚Äôam even though they are colleagues.",

        "post": "I am 30M working for a product based company in Bangalore. Since 2 years, most of my friends got scattered and all my female friends got married(eventually lost touch completely). Getting a girl to marry or date was also not working out. Ever since, loneliness started to haunt me and I was finding it very tough to even get a friend to watch a movie or go for a dinner on weekends. I have seen quite a lot of posts talking about loneliness and how hard it is to make friends in Bangalore. But the comment section did not come out with satisfactory answers. Here are some ways which helped me to good extent to overcome loneliness:\n\n1. Toastmaster club: I joined this club within my organisation and after repeatedly attending the sessions, slowly I am able to build relationships. It is one of the coolest way to find a good connection or friendship.\n2. BYOC hostel: if you are a person with backpacker vibes, this is one of the coolest hostel located in the heart of Indiranagar surrounded by great restaurants/pubs. Jigar is a great host and makes sure you feel comfortable. The crowd is cool and very friendly. I have seen few folks who are staying for months now. The con is you will have to stay in a bunk bed and shared washrooms.\n3. Zostel Indiranagar: 2 years back it used to be awesome place and found some amazing people over here. Doctors, students, techies, backpacker and folks from many interesting professions which I was unheard of. The male to female ratio was very good. In recent times, the hostel has lost its charm. A new zostel in kormangla has started recently and I have heard good reviews. This is an expensive option but you are likely to meet interesting folks if you stay over a month.\n4. Plantheunplanned trek group: If you are into trekking, this is one very good travel group. They make sure to conduct ice breaker events and you won‚Äôt feel lonely. I went with them twice and made some good friends. They tend to have a good mix of both male and female trekkers.\n5. Sublime camps: If you are from Karnataka or Kannada speaking person, I would recommend this travel group. They are a travel group based out of Tumkur and the organisers are extremely friendly. They also make sure you don‚Äôt feel lonely if you are a solo traveller.\n6. Tripper trails: I had few friends of mine who tried this and recommended me. The google reviews are extremely good and I am planning to try this one. They are more into visiting touristy places.\n7. Karnataka hikes and clean events:They attract primarily crowd from Karnataka and few of my friends had pretty good experience with them. I am yet to get time to travel with them. \n8. Muddie trails/ adventure Buddha: This is purely based on reviews from my friends. They also are a good option to travel with. I am yet to travel with them.\n9. Oopar club: This is one of the coolest socialising clubs I found in recent times and I wish I found out earlier. If you are new to the city and want to socialise, this is a good starting point. They have an official website listing the various activities they conduct on every weekend. I met a lot of techies and folks from other professional background.\n10. Randomly talking to colleagues within org: The crowd in my org in general are approachable. We have a gym inside the company and during workouts, I have taken the initiative to smile and talk to people randomly. 70% of them time, folks responded positively and made some good connections. If you repeatedly meet them and if vibe matches, they tend to invite you for restaurants/dinner or any other events.\n\nTravel groups or hostel to avoid:\n1. Zylo Indiranagar \n2. House of stories\n3. Hosteller near mg road\n4. BMC /namma trip : They used to be very good in the past but in recent times lost the charm it seems. I got to know based on the conversation I had during trekking with plantheunplanned\n5. Thrillophilia: Many of my friends had bad experience\n6. Small world: it is staged and not worthy\n7. Thrifty social: it‚Äôs surprising they have crazy following in Instagram. They don‚Äôt maintain proper gender ratio and not at all worth for the money you pay. It is very expensive for guys. I went for their event and was absolutely pissed of. Total waste of money.\n8. We play: I attended this event in Cubbon park and the gender ratio was horror. Pathetic experience and time waste.\n",

Six months ago, we partnered with a local recycling facility in Malleshwaram, and we were able to collect over 20 bags of clothes for recycling (not in condition for donation). We also managed to donate 29 pieces of clothing in good condition (no stains or holes).\n\nThis time around, we circulated a survey to gather feedback on what might encourage more students to participate in the drive. The response has been overwhelming, with over 890 students expressing interest! A lot of them mentioned they would be more inclined to donate if there was a cashback or incentive for the clothes they contributed, similar to how paper recycling centers pay based on weight.\n\nIf you happen to know any centers or companies that offer cashback for donated clothes, I‚Äôd love to get in touch with them for our upcoming drive. We‚Äôre tentatively planning to hold it in the first week of December, and any support or leads you can share would be a huge help.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I was already pretty annoyed with the heat and road conditions, but I pulled over as he asked.\n\nHe takes one look at my bike and says, \"Why is your number plate in this font?\" I asked what the issue was, and he told me it was an old sticker type, and I should get it replaced. I said fine, I'd get it done.\n\nThen he hits me with, \"You need to pay a fine for it.\" I asked him to explain the rule because I genuinely didn't know this was a problem. But he gets frustrated and says, \"Everyone‚Äôs asking me the same thing; I can‚Äôt explain this whole rule to each person.‚Äù\n\nI told him, \"Okay, if it‚Äôs an issue, just put the fine on the vehicle‚ÄîI‚Äôll sort it out in court if needed.\" He paused for a second, then said, \"If we go that route, we‚Äôd have to take your vehicle to court.\" I was like, \"Alright, let‚Äôs do it.\"\n\nAfter about 30 seconds, He backed off and told me to get it changed within 10 days, or I might face a 500‚Çπ fine, which doubles on a repeat offense.\n\nSometimes, standing your ground actually works! So, the next time when someone stops in the motive of just luring the money please talk for yourselves and tell them to put fine on the vehicle and you'll pay in the court. They would most probably just leave you.\n\nAlso, there's a new rule regarding the HSRP number plate thing in Karnataka. Please Google it and do the necessary to Save Yourself from these kind of cops.",

        "title": "True cost of ordering from Zomato based on two recent orders",
        "post": "Since zomato has started charging high platform fee and a bunch of other fees along with end of discounts in most restaurants I see that even the most basic order ends up being north of 200 for one person.\n\nSo recently I decided that I would just go to the restaurant and get takeaway. Here are the two cases:\n\nBreakfast from Babai Tiffins: Dosa and Idli. Zomato cost with free delivery 258 rupees. Getting from restaurant 182 rupees. Zomato charges 10 rupees platform fee and GST on it. The item prices are inflated by 20-30%. I found that even packaging fees are inflated on Zomato. The inflated menu prices do not include GST. All said and done I would have paid 66 rupees extra even after having zomato gold. That is 36% higher.\n\nGlen's Bakehouse: Croissant Donuts etc. The bakery had no packaging fees and their menu prices included the GST. I ended up paying 332. On zomato the same items cost 437. Menu prices are higher by 17-18%. Then there is packaging fees which you don't have to pay if you order at the restaurant. You get same packaging though. Add handling fee on top of that and you have the difference of 107 or 32% in this case. Btw, packaging fees scales with order amount. So effectively it is an up charge.\n\nEven with free delivery and relatively larger order size you end up paying 30-40% extra on Zomato.\n\nZOMATO only makes sense if there is a discount offer on the restaurant which has become so rare nowadays. If you're ordering for one then you have to order more than you normally would to reduce delivery charge or get free delivery if you have zomato gold.\n\nI am lucky enough that I live close to so many good restaurants and I can get there in 5 minutes on bike. Glen's took no time but I had to wait for Dosa a little as it was Sunday morning and the place was crowded due to high demand.\n\nThis brings me to another service restaurants can provide. Order online only for pickup. That would eliminate the occasional wait times. When zomato and swiggy were giving huge discounts it didn't make sense as you could always order for cheaper than picking up at the restaurant but now there is a huge gap and unless restaurants start charging handling fee on that too, they just might since a lot of restaurants charge packaging fee even though takeaways are cheaper for restaurants than dine in customers.\n\nWhat have your recent experiences been?",

        "post": "I‚Äôve been commuting from Indiranagar (SV Road) to WTC (SS Factory), usually by metro. While it might sound ideal, believe me, Bangalore‚Äôs metro is no saviour. It‚Äôs packed to the brim, so I end up standing for an hour each way, lugging my laptop bag, which has only left me with constant back, shoulder, and knee pain. Also, it takes 1 hour each way, involving changing lines at Majestic. I am a big supporter of public transportation to fight climate change and declog our roads. But last week, after a year of this, I decided to switch to cabs with full company reimbursement. But surprise, even booking Uber Premium and Ola Prime Plus (INR 800 per trip for 15 kms) barely changed things ‚Äì drivers refuse to turn on the AC! Out of 20 rides, only 3 actually used it.\n\nNot needing the AC for the chillness, just for some breathable space, I‚Äôm finding it impossible to relax for those 3-hour daily rides through Bangalore‚Äôs traffic and the constant dust, emissions and honking (yes my commute time has gone up now). BlueSmart doesn't service West Bangalore yet, so if I‚Äôm paying top dollar for these cabs and still getting no AC, what‚Äôs the point? I try asking politely but don‚Äôt have the energy for a daily argument. Any tips for getting drivers to switch on the AC? I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end and seriously wondering if metro hell is still the lesser evil here. \n\nAlso, I travel quite frequently to other cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai. Over there, the going in position is that any cab will promise a AC ride, Uber Go or Ola Mini. I don't know why this is only an issue in Bengaluru. \n\nTL;DR: Shifted from metro to Uber Premium/Ola Prime Plus for work commute but drivers rarely turn on the AC despite paying INR 800+ each way for 15 kms. Any tips for a guaranteed AC ride?\n\nUpdate: Thanks for all the responses, everyone! Seems like we‚Äôre all on the same page‚Äîgetting drivers to turn on the AC in Bangalore is a bit of a mission. Apparently, it takes some creative tactics! Also, lots of you mentioned this is mainly an issue with Ola and Uber, so I'll definitely give the AC cabs on Namma Yatri, Rapido, and BluSmart a shot",

It is the rich who are encroaching our roads with parking.\n\nIn the last few months, the number of people deciding that they have a right to park on the road outside their homes has increased dramatically. Look at areas in Indiranagar, New Tippasandra and Koramangala, and you'll see that most roads have become single file because people park outside their homes. Are their vehicles blocking traffic or causing inconvenience? Who cares? So what if the other half of the road is dug up? People will still park outside their homes and not shift an inch!\n\nI'm not even talking about valet parking in these areas for customers. These are cars that have been parked because there is no parking inside the premises. It's become such a menace that in some areas, we see two lines of vehicles parked on either side. I doubt even ambulances or fire engines can cross some of these roads.\n\nThere should be a special heavy penalty on people parking huge vehicles like Tata Safari, Fortuners, XUV700, Thar, Volvo and Innovas around corners. You can hardly see incoming traffic in turns. If you can spend so much money buying a car, you better have parking inside your premises. \n\nPeople will quickly make an argument about them paying taxes and having a right to this. I pay taxes as well, but I park inside my building within my alloted parking spots. I ask visitors to park in areas where they don't inconvenience others. \n\nEven worse is that after the ruckus around towing in no parking areas, the rich have been emboldened to park anywhere, and pick up quarrels with anyone who questions them. Bangalore Traffic Police seems too stretched to do anything about this. And our political leaders have grand visions about building tunnel roads and flyovers, while letting this go unpunished.\n\nIn a year or so, I foresee that we will all be crawling on all roads because of unpunished parking. Unless these guys are fined now, and heavily, this will just grow. We'll have poeple dying because ambulances and fire engines are not able to get through and children being forced to spend additional hours in school buses because their buses are slowed to a crawl. But who cares? I have money, so I have a right to the road.\n\nOn a sadistic note, we should have a rule that if you park on the roads overnight, any damage to your car is your own responsibility, and will not be covered by insurance.

How are children getting influenced to behave in this manner? It‚Äôs heartbreaking and infuriating to think that a kid would find this kind of behavior acceptable, let alone act on it.

It was a Monday, so traffic was slow-moving near the underground bridge opposite. I was waiting in line when a girl driving a red Seltos bumped into my bike, hitting my left leg. My leg swelled up the next day, but she didn't even roll down her window or say sorry. As an introvert, I didn‚Äôt want to make a scene and just moved on as traffic picked up. But it stayed with me.\n\nScene 2 (today): Near the Kartik Nagar bus stop, where there‚Äôs some construction going on, traffic was crawling again. A cab driver in a white Swift ran over my foot while I was waiting. This time people gathered, and I could hear some yelling, but the driver just took off. I'm so thankful my Woodland shoes took the brunt of it, rn I am in jeevika hospital. Waiting for doc consultation.\n\nThe crazy part is that both times, I wasn‚Äôt even moving‚Äîjust waiting my turn. I don‚Äôt understand why everyone‚Äôs in such a rush here that they can‚Äôt even stop for a second and watch out for others. It‚Äôs making me question if commuting by bike is even worth it. üòû",

        "post": "I had a bitter experience yesterday. I just moved two days back and yesterday I had to go out for the first time. The rapido guy took advantage the instance he got the chance.\n\nIt was taking time to book a ride on the rapido and I was getting late, at the same time another rapido captain dropped a passenger so I asked him if he could drop me. He \"clearly\" asked how much it's showing on app and I said 40 and showed him too. It was only 1.5 km. He gestured to sit on the bike. \n\nI was telling him the directions too. When my destination arrived, when the entire road is empty, he stopped so close to another bike waiting there (it also felt like another rapido captain) I had to carefully step down, if I touched the bike behind me I'd have lost my balance, it was that close. I didn't understand why he'd stop that close to another bike when the entire¬†road near the sidewalk¬†is¬†empty.\n\nI went to the other side, tried to scan, it didn't scan, he took my phone, scanned and entered rs 69, retyped it to rs 60. I said no app shows 40 then he raised his voice on me \"maine 60 bola\". I didn't say anything, I'm much smaller and he's two times bigger than me. I wouldn't get into a fight for rs 20 where I'm at the disadvantage. \n\nBut like he so \"clearly and loudly\" asked how much it showed on app, I showed him and he turned his away to check the traffic, maybe he mumbled something then, I have no idea. I don't even want to believe this is on me or my naivety. Just some street smarts from the driver. \n\nThis seems minor but first time I was out and already somebody got the better of me. I won't post every time such a thing happens though. You might wonder then how was it when I arrived. We booked a cab, I was hoping he'd understand Telugu (I'm from Andhra) because he stopped on the opposite lane from ours but he politely spoke in Hindi so we managed. But this is the first time I was out for some work. \n\nThis instance doesn't look like a scam from the beginning because one can't guess what's coming in situations like this because there are no hints and nothing seems fishy. I'll share a couple of more similar incidents that happened in Hyderabad with me on that sub later.\n\nWhat do you guys think, should I have done something else??\n\nTldr: Urgent work. Rapido booking took time. Another rapido dropped somebody in front of me, I asked to drop. He agreed. Showed it's 40 on app, when dropped he demanded 60. I paid and felt shitty. \n\n",

        "post": "I believe our city‚Äôs genuine solution to traffic would come from 4 main avenues:\n\n1) Prioritisation of public transport including buses and metro and even local trains. Even simply buses and metros with live tracking will help public plan their travel.\n2) Cracking down on the auto gundaism. Autos are an already available solution to the last mile connectivity problem but their looting and simply saying no is the main reason ppl prefer to take their own vehicles. \n3) Efficient traffic signals. I am glad IISC and traffic police have entered an MoU for making traffic problems solvable and hope something good comes out of it soon, but come on we all know how poorly managed some manual signals really are. I believe there are efficient ways to control those light and why cant they simply add timers on all of them. It helps everybody standing in the jam know that after 47s we get to 30s to move our wagons out of that misery.\n4) Fix the damn potholes. A dedicated team in BBMP to just fix potholes. They will be the busiest team and definitely lots of limelight and attention, so if they even have want to do it just for PR, do a good job of this. I literally apologise to my car and bike whenever I take through those damn ditches. \n\n",

        "post": "I want to warn others about my terrible experience with Xulifestyle, a short-term rental company in Bangalore. I rented a room from them, and it‚Äôs been a nightmare. First, my advance deposit of ‚Çπ1 lakh still hasn‚Äôt been returned, even though I vacated the flat over 65 days ago. When I followed up, a support representative, who had been making empty promises, told me to ‚Äúf\\*\\*\\* off‚Äù and that I could do whatever I wanted. Additionally, their customer service is a joke‚ÄîI was given the complete runaround whenever I tried to get an update on my refund. I had to chase multiple executives who either ignored my messages or kept saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs in process‚Äù with no real progress.\n\nInitially, I was told there would be a standard deduction of ‚Çπ3,000, but they later forced me to sign a new agreement, increasing it to a full month‚Äôs rent. Their reason? ‚ÄúRe-painting and cleaning charges‚Äù‚Äîeven though I saw no such maintenance done when previous tenants left.\n\nThey also have a habit of making endless excuses when it comes to basic repairs. I faced constant issues like leaking taps, broken appliances, and unclean common areas. Each time I raised a maintenance request, they either ignored it or took weeks to respond. Despite paying a premium for ‚Äúfully-serviced‚Äù accommodation, I ended up handling repairs myself most of the time.\n\nTheir acquisition team will say anything to get you in the door, promising everything from 24/7 support to quick issue resolution, but when it comes to delivering, they‚Äôre nowhere to be found. For example, I had to wait over 60 days just to get a basic society ID card after moving in, which was crucial for accessing amenities and security.\n\nAnd as for their CEO, Mohit? Completely unresponsive. I tried reaching out to him directly after exhausting all other options, but he ignored every message. Overall, I‚Äôd strongly advise anyone to avoid Xulifestyle if they‚Äôre looking for a place to stay in Bangalore. The lack of professionalism, delays in refunds, poor maintenance, and hidden charges made this one of the worst rental experiences I‚Äôve ever had.",

The purpose of the change also looks really ambiguous (see mail from ACT below). When I followed up on this, I was contacted by the customer support, and informed that when we sign up for a new account/connection, we also agree to the fact that the company can choose to change the tariff/plan by sending out an intimation to the customer. Not sure if I am overreacting; but this looks like a dark, non-customer first way of doing things. It looks like this community does not allow to upload images.

We, at ACT Fibernet are happy to have you as a loyal customer & assure you of an ultra-fast experience. Your Storm plan has been upgraded. This upgrade will come at a nominal increase of Rs.14 in your current Rs.1185 internet plan. The revised pricing will be Rs.1199 per month. This price change will be effective from 1st November 2024, and will apply to you from your next renewal. The purpose of this change is to ensure that you benefit from faster speeds, enhanced reliability, and an overall superior internet experience. Please be assured that this adjustment has been thoughtfully considered to keep it as minimal as possible. We genuinely appreciate your understanding as we strive to deliver the highest level of service.\n\nMail from me:\n\nHello ACT team\n\nThanks for informing me that this is happening.

Why is this coming as an FYI, and not something that you would first ask the customers if they would want to opt in? I understand the increase in amount in minimal, but money is money, and user consent must not be taken lightly.\n2. Could you please provide me more visibility into why this change was necessary? How does this change ensure better reliability and an overall superior internet experience? BTW, what does ‚Äúoverall superior internet experience‚Äù even mean? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.  \n",

        "post": "So, here I am, sitting in my Bangalore flat at 2 a.m., minding my own business, scrolling through endless posts about \"unlocking life's true potential\" and \"finding hidden keys within yourself.\" Usually, I ignore this motivational stuff, but I‚Äôd had three cups of chai and was feeling philosophical. I decided that *tonight* was the night to find my true purpose.\n\nGoogle led me to an ancient legend ‚Äì an old Bangalore tale about \"The Ultimate Secret,\" hidden right within the city, which, if found, would reveal everything you ever wanted to know. \"Find the missing clue on MG Road,\" it said. Perfect. That was just around the corner!\n\nI threw on a hoodie, grabbed a flashlight for dramatic effect, and set out. MG Road was calm, dimly lit, with just a few stray dogs and a lone street vendor selling tea. I asked him if he‚Äôd heard about \"The Ultimate Secret,\" and he squinted, shrugged, and said, ‚ÄúTry Cubbon Park, boss. Everything secret starts there.‚Äù\n\nOff I went to Cubbon Park, wandering around in the dark, convinced I was about to uncover some mystical truth. Every shadow felt like a clue; every rustling leaf was a sign. A security guard eventually noticed me and walked over.\n\n‚ÄúLooking for something?‚Äù\n\nI nodded, deciding to be honest. ‚ÄúThe Ultimate Secret. You know, the one about life?‚Äù\n\nHe sighed and pointed to a bench. ‚ÄúSit there and wait. All will be revealed.‚Äù\n\nI sat. And waited. A full half-hour went by, and then he returned‚Ä¶ holding a dusty mirror from the maintenance shed.\n\n‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he said, handing it to me. ‚ÄúLook closely.‚Äù\n\nSo I did, waiting for the grand revelation. But all I saw was my own face, my tired eyes staring back. I looked up, and the guard grinned.\n\n‚ÄúUltimate Secret,‚Äù he said, tapping the mirror, ‚Äúis that you‚Äôre just as clueless as the rest of us, boss.‚Äù\n\nAnd with that, he walked away. I headed home, realizing I'd just spent two hours in the middle of the night... all to be handed a mirror by a guy in Cubbon Park.",

I had my laptop, a backpack, and realized too late that I‚Äôd forgotten my glasses. As I exited his building, I noticed two middle-aged men on a bike drive past, only to stop about 50 meters ahead near a tea point, acting as though they were taking pictures. Their behavior seemed odd, so I pretended to be on a call and walked past them.\n\nOne of the men suddenly asked, \"Ma'am, where do you live?\" Startled, I responded with, \"Why do you care?\" and quickly turned back, heading towards my brother's building as fast as I could. They kept repeating the question, following me as I walked back. I made it inside and rushed up to my brother's floor, with them watching until they saw me enter. Even then, they lingered outside, waiting.\n\nOnce I was safely upstairs, I called my brother, telling him someone had followed me. That seemed to scare them off, and they left. My brother came down immediately and returned about 10 minutes later, this time accompanied by two police officers on a different bike.\n\nOne of the officers was smiling as I recounted what happened. Then, in broken English, they explained that it was them the whole time and that they were ‚Äúpatrolling‚Äù to prevent theft in the area. They hadn‚Äôt been in uniform initially and were on a completely different bike, which added to the confusion.\n\nI was shaken to the core by the incident. I couldn't help but question why they hadn‚Äôt identified themselves as police officers and why they waited until I called my brother before leaving. Why would they ask me where I lived without clarifying who they were?\n\nI'm left wondering if this is common or if anyone else in the area has had a similar experience. Is this really how patrolling works here?",

But there's one big favor that other drivers would appreciate from you: please be mindful of your headlight's high beam. When driving within city limits, your car‚Äôs high beam lights creates intense glare for oncoming drivers and those ahead of you. High beams are to be used only to illuminate poorly-lit highways and rural roads‚Äînot busy, well-lit streets in the city, specially with oncoming traffic. The MVA states that high beams should only be used in the following circumstances: On dark or poorly lit roads and When no other vehicles are approaching.\n\nI'm assuming most of these folks are not even aware of it's usage because I mostly see a lot of very modest cars with young/new drivers driving on high beams and when I try to communicate that they have their high beam turned on, they are not sure why I'm pointing that out. Please treat this as an educational post.\n\nWondering how to check if you're on high beam? Look at your car's dashboard: when high beams are on, there‚Äôs usually a blue light indicator. Each time you‚Äôre about to drive in the city, make it a habit to glance at your dashboard, especially if you've noticed oncoming cars flashing their lights at you as a signal. By sticking to low beams, you‚Äôre helping make the roads safer.\n\nPlease spread the word with anyone you know who has recently bought a car or someone who gives vision impairment as a reason on the regular to drive on high-beam in the city.",

Tonight, after dropping my girlfriend home after a late movie, I was on my way back when my petrol ran out‚Äîright in the middle of the road, just before reaching Koramangala, at 2 AM. With no options, I started pushing my bike toward the nearest petrol pump by St. John‚Äôs Hospital.\n\nOut of nowhere, a young guy, maybe around 22, stopped on his two-wheeler and asked what was wrong. When he heard my story, he didn‚Äôt hesitate to offer a helping hand, towing me along by keeping his leg on the back of my bike. About 100 meters from the pump, he mentioned he had to turn another way and asked if I could manage. I thanked him, and he sped off before I could even properly express my gratitude.\n\nWhen I finally reached the pump, it was closed. Frustrated and exhausted, I started the trek to the next one near Madiwala. I must‚Äôve been quite the sight, panting and sweating, because two teenagers who‚Äôd passed by actually turned back and asked if I needed help. They offered to tow me as well and stayed with me until I reached the pump. I tried to thank them with an offer of tea, but they politely declined.\n\nTo an outsider, this might seem like a small thing, but for me, it was huge. Despite it being 2 AM, with a fair number of people still on the road, these strangers took a moment to stop and help without hesitation. Their kindness turned a stressful night into something unforgettable, and it‚Äôs truly changed my perspective on the people of Bangalore.

        "post": "I'm writing this from my bed, recovering from a knee injury‚Äîone I never anticipated, especially not from a routine commute.\n\nA few weeks ago, I opted for a Rapido bike ride to the office. Fate, perhaps? I usually choose an auto, but the skyrocketing surcharges that morning led me to reconsider. The rider arrived, I hopped on, and off we went. About halfway to the office, we turned onto a narrow road when, suddenly, I saw a car about 30 meters ahead come to a dead stop. Without warning, the driver abruptly threw it into reverse, turning sharply right. Our bike had no time to react.\n\nWe collided, and the bike skidded for several meters. In those split seconds, I braced myself, desperately shielding my head‚Äîthankfully, since the thin helmet provided by Rapido offered little more than a false sense of security. My arm and shoulder absorbed most of the impact, but as I hit the ground, pain shot through my knee like fire. I was disoriented, and the realization struck hard: I couldn‚Äôt put weight on my leg. I felt a searing pain that forced a scream from my throat. Passersby came to my aid, helping me to the side of the road, where everything became a hazy blur. The Rapido rider, meanwhile, was yelling, gripping the car driver by the collar, and the two men were embroiled in a heated fight just a few feet away.\n\nBarely two minutes later, both of them were gone‚ÄîVANISHED, leaving me alone and broken on the roadside.\n\nAn ambulance arrived soon after, rushing me to a nearby hospital. Diagnosis: torn knee ligaments and a severely sprained ankle. Recovery, they say, could take months.\n\nI‚Äôm not here to argue who was at fault. I just want to share this as a caution. This could have been anyone, and maybe, somewhere out there, drivers with a sense of accountability exist. But it‚Äôs impossible to tell them apart.\n\nRapido takes no responsibility for the actions of their riders. So next time you consider hopping on, and you strap on that flimsy, laughable excuse for a helmet, ask yourself‚Äîis it worth it? ",

When I moved in, I was assured by their sales representative that although I‚Äôd be signing a 6-month eqaro bond, it could be canceled anytime. So I had signed the 6 page long agreement without reading the whole content trusting the sales representative. This flexibility was a key factor in my decision.\n\n\nNow, when I need to check out early due to some health issue, I found out this wasn‚Äôt true. After raising a ticket on their app, I was informed that I‚Äôd still be billed for three more months, regardless of my actual stay. Customer support hasn‚Äôt been responsive at all.\n\n\nThen I reached out to the higher management in hopes of resolving this. But the co-founder of the FF21 was also a bit arrogant and said that I have to pay the next three months rent and then the checkout will be approved. It‚Äôs frustrating and feels like a clear misrepresentation of terms. Fyi I am still a student who was completing my internship in a company and I am dropping out due to some health reasons I faced during my stay in Bangalore. But the co-founder says that the bond doesn't have any exception and I have to pay the full rent and then leave the property. Currently I don't have so much money to pay the full three months rent. Guys I'm stuck in a very tough situation and it's taking a toll on my mental health too.

Initially I thought that it was a coincidence that he and I were going the same way, but after a point I realized that he was walking with me. He did not interact with me - no looking at me, no playing with me, no wagging of tail, and most of the times, he either walked ahead of me, or behind me, and would occasionally stop at places, but would catch up with me eventually.\n\nHe would cross roads with me, and if we somehow ended up on opposite sides of the road, he would wait for the vehicles to pass so that he could cross to come to the same side as mine. If he went too far ahead of me, he would slow down, and even look back to see if I was there, and then would resume. I also saw him looking for me when he lost sight of me. At some point I thought that he must be looking for food, so I bought and offered him a treat. He did not even look at it. I felt he was wary, and he didn't show any affection unlike other dogs. He just gave me company.\n\nAt a point, I had to go to a store. At that time, he was walking ahead of me. So, when he looked back and saw me entering the store, he decided to wait for me outside the store. When I came out from the store, he showed some excitement and leaped towards me, but became normal soon, and continued walking.\n\nWe came close to my house when other dogs in my vicinity started barking at him. He stopped and kept looking back at me. I had been trying to make him go because I knew that this would happen, and now was the time I had to let him go. So, I felt emotional and stood there for a bit. With a heavy heart, I resumed walking towards my home hoping he would go away now. But, he tried coming towards me still. But the dogs chased him away. I waited there to see if he safely escaped them. He did. It was late night, so I couldn't do much. Also, I can't adopt him because I am not ready for that responsibility and where I live, pets aren't allowed.\n\nI feel so emotional right now recalling how he gave me company till my home and that I couldn't do anything but let him go.\n\nHas anyone else had such fleeting encounters with stranger dogs?",

Despite my previous positive experience in moving smaller items, this time was a disaster.\n\nPorter's packers and movers came at a cheap price, but ultimately, I paid more if I would have opted for a proper packers and movers service. The service partners were unprofessional and are mostly a small gang who jus own a Tata Ace. They wrapped my TV in a thin, Porter approved blue jacket material despite requests for additional protective layers and handled it carelessly, carrying it on single person's shoulders like how bahubali carries the shivalinga. \n\nUpon arrival, I discovered that they had laid the TV's edge directly on the van's floor. The team rushed through unpacking, urging us to unpack the boxes provided by Porter. During that time they immediately laid down the TV for photos before leaving. As I misplaced the TV cable, i couldn't check the TV immediately. The next day, I found that they had cracked the panel of my three-month-old TV.\n\nEven though i have fair share of blame to bear for what happened, The problem with Porter and similar aggregator services is their inability to control service quality and lack of proper guardrails. Raising a complaint was challenging, as they have a 24-hour window for claims, which wasn't clearly stated in their terms and conditions during initial booking.\n\nAs a caution, I advise against using Porter for moving delicate or valuable items. \n\nTL;DR:\n\n1. Porter broke my 3-month-old 55\" TV\n2. For any claims Raise it within 24 hours of service. Hence unwrap the things quickly without procrastinating it\n3. Avoid Porter for moving valuable items as they cannot control the service quality \n4. With packers and moves review their claims process and time limit within which you need to raise\n5. Don't throwaway your TV box. It will be a lifesaver during shifting.",

If we want our country to improve rapidly and reach the level of Singapore or Dubai, we should not expect change from politicians.The change must come at the grassroot level i.e people. People should start taking responsibility and have a sense of unity and should try to lead by example. A personal anecdote from my life: when i initially came to banglore, me and my friends used to think that it is ok to not learn kannada as we used to manage day to day activities using hindi. Even though there was no need for me to learn kannada, one day I suddenly realised my ignorance and laziness and started my kannada journey. With my perseverance, i became decently fluent in kannada in just 2 months and most of friends were surprised by the way I was conversing with kannada natives in kannada.Even native kannadigas, complimented my pronounciation skills and ability. Upon seeing that , my friends subconsciously started to feel the guilt themselves and they are now making an effort to learn as well. Even though I did not force them to learn kannada , they started to make an effort upon seeing my example. Similarly, we can be responsible in other facets of our life by keeping our surroundings clean, helping others, being kind etc. Even though this might take time , once enough people become responsible and stop being lazy, the postive effects will cascade to other people ,which in turn will benefit our country. Always choose love,kindness and responsibility instead of hate and laziness.Life is not a zero sum game, all of us can win together and everyone can have a piece of pie instead of only greedy few.",

The long-standing congestion at Silk Board will see some relief once the flyover on the opposite side opens. Even with one side being open, it has solved a large portion  of traffic problems.\n\nI am concerned about what is unfolding just outside the New Horizon Engineering College on the Outer Ring Road, The road in front of New Horizon College gate is planned to be widened in to a 150 foot wide highway and extended all the way to Kolar. Despite this road being in the works for 20 years, local politicians haven't made meaningful efforts to improve its design at the spot where the road merges in to ORR. Adding to the problem, the new highway won‚Äôt have an underpass where it meets ORR, as metro pillars are already in place. In a few years, this area is set to become the world's worst bottleneck, where a 150 foot wide highway will converge into a service road - What a sad outcome !  Given that there will be no provision of underpass, entry from the ORR on the road will also be difficult and will clog other spots on the ORR. \n\nJust imagine all the traffic from Whitefield and Varthur that will congest this very spot. A few tech parks were initially planned along this route in Varthur, but they were canceled after investors withdrew, citing concerns over the future traffic problems at this spot. Eventually, developers opted to build residential flats instead, and buyers are eagerly purchasing these properties with the assumption that road will be constructed soon.  Is anyone more gullible than flat buyers who believe this road will be completed soon? Several sections of the road have already been completed, but private landowners are hindering further progress. The BDA is overseeing the construction, yet, surprisingly, both the BBMP and the forest department have raised concerns about land acquisition as well. So the road is disconnected at several locations.  It is proposed that BDA will build this road till Kolar district under CDP/RMP plan and from there state government will take the road forward to other places. ",

My house owner paati and thaatha, who live next door came back from their son‚Äôs house and was glad to see the dias lit, but rain had washed away the kolam, they brought me snacks and sweets.

        "title": "Embrace our language & culture! ",
        "post": "The saying \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do\" suggests that it's respectful and often beneficial to follow the customs of the place you‚Äôre visiting or moving to. \nHowever, it‚Äôs less common to see people actually embracing this idea within India. Often, when people move to a different state, they expect locals to adjust to their language and lifestyle rather than adopting the language and customs of the place they‚Äôve moved to. Why not focus on integrating and becoming a part of the new community, appreciating its culture and traditions?\n\nA certain tweet & news from yesterday, then a long conversation from a few months back with one of the Reddit buddies, here's my two cents (stating the obvious) - \n\n1. Embrace the Local Culture and Lifestyle |\n\nWhen moving to a new state or city, adapt to the local way of life and embrace the customs and traditions. You‚Äôre being welcomed into a new community, so appreciate the warmth and opportunities. Show respect by making an effort to understand and participate in the local culture.\n\n\n2. Learn the Local Language |\n\nIf your job involves interacting with locals daily, make an effort to learn the language. Communicating in Kannada (or any regional language) shows respect and helps you connect better with the community. Language skills also enhance your ability to serve and engage more effectively.\n\n\n3. Be Open-Minded and Flexible | \n\nMoving to a new place may bring changes in lifestyle, routines, and perspectives. Approach these differences with an open mind, as adapting requires a positive outlook. Be flexible, whether it‚Äôs regarding food, traditions, or social norms, as this openness will help you settle in smoothly. Stop complaining about everything! \n\n\n4. Respect Local Etiquette and Social Norms |\n\nEvery place has its unique social norms and etiquette. Observe how locals interact, and take note of gestures, greetings, or behaviors that are appreciated. Respect these customs, as showing awareness of etiquette fosters goodwill and helps you avoid misunderstandings. A simple way to understand that would be to know when someone comes to our home, they adjust to space, they wouldn't come in & move the sofa because they aren't comfortable with it's setup. \n\n\n5. Build Connections with the Local Community |\n\nTake time to engage with your neighbors, colleagues, and local residents. Building relationships helps you feel more at home and creates a support network. Attend local events or join community groups to better integrate and make meaningful connections. If you show interest, people will be pleased to teach their culture, language & history. \n\n\n6. Avoid Imposing Your Language or Culture |\n\nRespect the local language and culture rather than imposing your own. If you‚Äôre moving to a state where another language is commonly spoken, like Kannada in Karnataka, try learning the basics. Expecting locals to communicate only in your language can come across as dismissive and may hinder your ability to connect with the community & cause retaliation. \n\n\n7. Avoid Arrogance About Development | \n\nBeing proud of your achievements is natural, but claiming credit for a city‚Äôs development as a newcomer can appear arrogant. Respect the contributions of locals and the hard work that shaped the city long before your arrival. Recognizing this fosters mutual respect and creates a more positive environment.\n\n\n8. Be Humble and Appreciative |\n\nRemember that moving to a new place is an opportunity, not an entitlement. Appreciate the warmth, openness, and opportunities the city offers and reciprocate with respect and humility. When locals see you making an effort, they‚Äôre often more welcoming and inclusive.\n\n\n9. Stop Hindi imposition |\n\nThe Indian Constitution does not designate any single language as the \"national language.\" The Constitution of India recognizes 22 scheduled languages under the Eighth Schedule, including languages such as Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Urdu, Odia, Kannada, and Malayalam. These languages have official status within their respective states and can be used for official state government communication.\n\n\n10. When in Karnataka, do as the Kannadigas do. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

However, once you move in, things get tough:\n\n* He adds unnecessary charges that were hidden in the rental agreement.\n* The lift gets turned off randomly, often citing fake power cuts.\n* He even turned off the lift for a pregnant tenant as a punishment for another tenant.\n* He tries to enter tenants' homes for inspections.\n* The building gate is locked 24/7, requiring us to use a common key every time we leave.\n* He constantly boasts about his connections with local politicians.\n* He doesn‚Äôt provide the 200 units of free government electricity that tenants should receive.\n* He also doesn‚Äôt give us the electricity and water bills.\n\nAfter six months (the lock-in period), he makes it difficult for tenants to stay and charges one month‚Äôs rent from the deposit when they leave.

They agreed, took the money. Saying true devaru bhakta wouldn‚Äôt had hesitated with 1000. They didn‚Äôt even had any receipts.\n\nIts been two year I am in bangalore, this is first time such incident happened. On other side I was suffering from dengue from last week, and that was also eating up on whatever cash i had. I really loved the city, but today my heart ached seeing the event unfold. ",

To make it worse, the washrooms were filthy ‚Äì dirty floors, broken faucets, and no proper cleaning in sight.\n\nI get it they are extensively promoting to go to 080 at T1 for a premium experience, but this was honestly disappointing. Nowadays there's almost no free Lounge access and on top of that its really annoying to see situation like this. Hope someone in management steps up and fixes this mess.",

        "post": "I came here to discuss some of doubts with excellent mind in bangalore.\n\n\nBangalore has been widely popular for start-up friendly environment, wide cultural population, and yes trafic also.  So i also thought i should start my first ever start up from bangalore only.\n\nFor the past few years i was working as a freelance admission agent for various college in here and also for colleges in chennai. Now i think its the time for big game. \n\nEarning while working as admission agent is mostly through commission, so with my personal connection i managed to get enough sales for making my living untill this moment. \n\n\nSo i thought building a agency for the same. And when it comes to making this field as a permanent source of income, some questions are keep arising in my mind continuously which are,\n\n1. Personal limitation : eventhough if i work all day and night in 365 days in a year, there is a limit in number of students that i can personality connect and admit into institutions.\n\n2. Since the industry is widely open, there are a lot of agencies out there who doing the same.\n\n3. College admission are mostly happen march to july. So even after setting up an office it will become workless most of the time in an year.\n\n4. Since most of the agency work happens at march to july period. Keeping a permanent staff is became more and more difficult as i have to pay thier salary when they don't have anything to work.\n\n5. Most of the college associating with agencies aren't competent enough to tutor students. I have personally seen students end up not completing thier studies and doing some other work.\n\n6. Finally main problem is the revenue. Revenue is revolving around the commission we get for each admission for various institutions. So most of the payments will be getting us in august, September. So managing whole revenue and distributing for each month  expenses is really difficult.\n\n\nSo as a person who doesn't have any history of doing any buisness im having difficulty to think. \n\nSo my question is how to build and scale up this buisness into a successful company.\n\nHow can i improve this plan and inturn make more revenue.\n\n\nMost importantly how do i resolve staff issue. I want all individuals working for my company should remain permanent and build a big community.\n\n\n",

I asked why then he said it is needed for the license process. I was talking to a few guys earlier in the queue and asked them and all of them had paid the money. I said I had no cash to the guy he said thats okay I can phonepe. I send him money and he called somebody to give him the name. I dont know why I am typing this but I wish I had stood up for this more, at that time I was just thinking about my license. I dont know if I can do anything about it now.",
