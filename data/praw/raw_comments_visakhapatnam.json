Roads have widened and pollution became a thing.\nThe only eateries that haven't changed much in quality are Daspalla, Basha noodles point and Delicacies in MVP \nAlmost all other places like SaiRam parlour, Geetha mess and Dolphin hotel have increased prices and reduced the quality.\nLIC punugulu is now the paradise hotel of Hyderabad, the quality is a joke.\nAlpha hotel guy and Bombay restaurant are still compromising on quality while delivering quantity.\nThe latest trend is fancy coffee and Icecream shops. \nThe only people who have maintained consistency are the traffic police who run into the middle of the road to stop and issue a challan.\n\n\nHope this helps.",

I was also looking for redevelopment, but the majority decided to renovate all the plumbing, flooring, painting, etc. so everyone pooled in 1 lakhs for that - so redevelopment looks out of picture, and I personally would put some value to the structure, if not zero, considering the renovations. We are not in a rush to sell, so can wait for the best deal. And we‚Äôve got confirmation that bank loans will be given for our flat, since the documentation is in place.\nMany thanks Vamsi garu for your inputs.",

Bangalore is the only place where such a culture thrives (no, not even hyderabad despite what the dudes in the video feel). \n\nNobody really cares for \"real culture\" anyway.

I'd personally say u better prefer a train (a ticket in sleeper works) because you get to go through tunnels üòå, unless you want to stop at each viewpoint and get some pics clicked or smtg like that.\nAnd in araku, just get a cab to roam wherever u want. Using public transport there is not soo preferable because of the roads. \nNow coming to the vistadome thing, \nI'd never recommend u to book one, because it's not at all as in reels. You get to rotate Chairs and whatsoever, but ntg more than that.\nWe returned to vizag thru this and it was soon dark soo we couldn't get much of the view because of the glass windows. So it's only better  if it's during the day time.\nBut again, I'd say it's not worth 700 or so.\n\nHaving said that,\nHave a fun journey!",

Even if you find it outside at any bandi, it's just corn starch water and the taste is very bland.\n\nNon vegetarian soup:\nIn case of chicken soup, you can ask for soup made out of chicken bones as this has a lot of health benefits and is usually much tastier. You can find these at jagdamba, MVP, Zilla parishad, jail road and almost at all noodles and roll bandis.\nLet me know if this works",

She said on line that if they could get a letter from XYZ MLA the transfer posting gets done.\n\nI read that constables earn 4lpa after 5 years of service. This means MLAs give Batta everymonth for constables to survive.\n\nIn this scenario why will a constable ever take action against MLA who feeds him.\n\nI think the Political class on purpose tends not to increase their salaries, Such that they don't become independent.\n\nThere is need to rationalize the salaries of these employees.",

Pushpa 2 might be a crazy project but that still doesn‚Äôt justify the 1000rs ticket .. when you are charging that much then the movie makers are supposed to work with the movie theatre management and make sure smooth sailing of the premiere happens .. if not then it‚Äôll be a massacre like this or worse like the RTC x roads .. I‚Äôm not gonna comment on the movie but the sheer audacity with which they are charging 2x 3x ticket rates and justifying it is not at all acceptable .. telugu yuvatha should take a stand and stop going to movies when such things are normalised .. I get the whole demand and supply equation but when you know there is mob fanism and ‚ÄúAArmy‚Äù culture you have to make sure that the movie opens with a smooth transition rather than with a bang .. why the fuck was there no pvt security support provided by Mythri? Why the fuck did allu arjun go to a screening? When you own a fucking multiplex theatre that too .. if we are gonna accuse people and rank who‚Äôs responsible then I‚Äôm be \n\n1. The state govt for allowing such BS\n\n2. Mythri movie makers and Allu Arjun\n\n3. The City Police and administrative bodies \n\n4. Theatre management \n\n5. So called fan association leaders\n\n6. Fans\n\n7. Regular audience. \n\n\nThis has been a trend in TFI and KFI .. but KFI got their shit together .. Jr NTR and Boss got the shit controlled eventually .. there have been many instances where stampede was a given for Jr NTR events but things changed there .. instead of staying quiet the stars and the movie makers should take some fucking responsibility.\n\n\nThe state govt shouldn‚Äôt allow this in the first place but that‚Äôs a no go in India as we love people worshipping so the next best thing was the movie makers the city administrators and the theatre management having figured out things and plan properly. This is just bad on so many fucking levels.",

China also has this capability, and recently assisted Pakistan to attain it. This technology offers a sure-shot option to the countries that possess it.\n\nNow the thinking behind a nuclear sponge is that when you have stationary nuclear sites, like the US minuteman silos in the American Midwest or the facilities in Vizag and Rambilli, your adversary will prioritise using their nuclear weapons to take out yours. So in the US case, an adversary will need to expend about 400 nukes just to neutralise those silos, thus lessening the impact on the much more densely populated east and west coast. \nFor India, this would mean Vizag and Rambilli being wiped off the face of the earth, thus reducing the effects on the rest of the country.",

I‚Äôm no expert (have a RPL though which is irrelevant to the topic üòÅ) , but as far as I know, reconnaissance or spy planes typically fly at altitudes of 21‚Äì26 km. Even if there were an aircraft capable of reaching such heights (400+ km), the advanced cameras used on these planes would still struggle with atmospheric distortion at that range. And even if we assume the camera is exceptionally advanced, the Earth‚Äôs curvature would still block the line of sight. Unless the aircraft is essentially in low Earth orbit, like a satellite, capturing an image (such images) from that distance seems improbable.",

There is no clear signal within this visible and Near-IR light band to distinguish industries vs homes vs ships within Vizag, but if one can post process with chemicals in the air or precise spatial building type data, it can be done. I tried checking these latter but had no luck. More data with enough resolution for India needs to be available.\n\nthis is their formula encompassing - radiance scattering of atmosphere, surface albedo, backscatter, direct and diffuse radiation that is further dependent on water vapour and aerosols, probability of urban vegetation canopy (to correct areas where leaves can occlude light)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n3l6zj66ts2e1.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fbff2809dfa5f01c825e112e895f7ac210ac8d3",

        "post": "Thanks for the detailed breakdown! Now thinking about it, the juxtaposition with Chennai and Bangalore adds an interesting perspective to the analysis. It‚Äôs fascinating how much nuance goes into processing and calibrating this data (balancing atmospheric factors, surface albedo, radiance scattering, and vegetation interference.). \nOn the resolution challenge (s), ISRO‚Äôs Cartosat series or commercial satellites like Planet Labs might offer higher spatial detail to supplement VIIRS. Integrating these with machine learning models trained on labeled urban datasets could improve differentiation between industries and residential areas (and even ships - I saw the other thread üòÅ).\n\nAdditionally, incorporating temporal data could also help. For instance analyzing changes in radiance over time might hint at industrial activity patterns versus residential light (especially during non-peak hours). Seasonal NDVI data, as you pointed out could refine urban vegetation corrections, especially in areas where monsoons or cropping cycles influence canopy density.\nTo me It‚Äôs also intriguing to even just think about fusing this data with open-source air quality data. High levels of industrial pollutants (for e.g. SO‚ÇÇ or NO‚ÇÇ hotspots) could act as secondary indicators to better map industrial zones. Cross-referencing this with urban planning GIS layers might further improve spatial classification.\n\nI appreciate the value of more specific, high-resolution geospatial data, but I understand it can pose security concerns and its  availability is carefully managed to prevent potential misuse.\n\nExciting stuff- thanks for sharing these insights !",

With hills overviewing the sea, you can have a great experience. It‚Äôs an hour or 1.5 hours drive, through scenic steel plant roads. You can visit those 3 beaches (seethapalem, Tantadi and appikonda) for sunrise. Maybe seethapalem for sunset. If you‚Äôre looking for casuals or hookups try nightclubs, be respectful and shoot your shot, it will work out if it does. Moonbar, cosmic house and few other restrobars with dance floor are great on the weekends. You can also go to araku, right now temperatures are falling below 10 degrees there. It‚Äôs 100km from Vizag. Vanjangi for sunrise is unbeatable.",

The staff may come across as nonchalant and careless at times, but this is likely because they have a lot going on in the backend (I realized this after visiting a few times).\n\nRegarding vehicle conditions, their Activa 5G/6G, Suzuki Access, Dio BS5/BS6, Duke, FZ, and other higher CC bikes are consistently in good condition. The other gearless vehicles and the Honda Hornet are decent as well, but they might require some time to get used to, something I wouldn't necessarily recommend. If you are planning a long trip out of Visakhapatnam, then do avoid Activa 5G and Dio BS5, \n\nOverall, Royal Brothers can be a bit hit-and-miss, but the truth is, there's no one better than them in Visakhapatnam's bike rental space right now.",

        "post": "Helloo! Monday To Thursday if you book the vehicle for about 10 hours, then it will cost you around 250/- including taxes. This price is for those Activas and other gearless vehicles which have a less kilometre limit, which is up to 60KMS(Make sure you scroll down until you find the vehicles with less KM limit). So if you want to travel in and around Vizag, then this is best for you! But if you think you are gonna travel for more than 80 or 100KMS, then look for the Activa which has a higher KM limit. The gearless vehicles with higher KM limit cost you around 500-550/- per day( Monday to Sunday). Now, the reason why I have mentioned \" Monday To Thursday \" In the first line is that the gearless vehicles with less KM limits(Also budget friendly) are only available from Monday to Thursday. From Friday to Sunday the KM limit for all the vehicles shoots up, which in turn results in increase of the fare for every vehicle. I hope this info was helpfulü§ù",

They are basic antifungals that inhibit ergosterol synthesis and damage the integrity of the cell membrane of fungi.\nThe exact composition is also from Sclape of Glenmark (I use this now as my uni has it only)\n\nThere is also Scalpe+ and Sebamed, which has piroctone olamine and does the same inhibition attack but mildly. Scalpe+ also has another antifungal of climbazole. Both of these have conditioning and other things for long-term use under **mild attack or continuation** after ketoconazole.\n\nThe Cipla 8x version has ciclopirox and is a bit harder in general in stores to find. This works by breaking nutrient uptake in fungi. It has zinc pyrithione, too.\n\nPersonally,  I would start with cipla8x-kt or scalpe for around 8 weeks with every 3d wash and then switch to sebamed or scalpe+ on long-term usage every 5d or so.",

        "post": "I am just another user, not a dermatologist, and my message was only about my dermatologist and usage experience. Things vary widely between people and skin, so if your dermatologist suggests something different, follow that.\n\nWith that said, ketoconazole (cipla 8x kt or scalpe) will be harsh and may dry skin and cause itching. Hence, the main reason for the gap (every 2d or 3d as it has a better half-life) and why it is not advised for the long term - ideally stopped after 2 months if controlled.\n\nHowever, flareups do occur even after months, given one's skin predispositions, so there is a need for continuous treatment, which is why a milder antifungal version (sebamed) is better with **continuous** usage (every 5d or week or how it suits ur skin) after ur ketoconazole treatment is done\n\nAlso, use conditioner and hairoils while using ketoconazole (cipla 8x kt) shampoos. \nsebamed, anyway, has conditioners with it.",

I suggest you pick one from Araku, Lambasinghi, or Vanajangi. Araku is my top recommendation.\n\n If you have some extra time, you can also visit Kondakarla Ava, Seethamadhara Hanuman Temple, Thotlakonda, or Kambalakonda.",

        "post": "While breasts are often considered sexual or even \"indecent\" when exposed, I believe that this perception is unnecessary. The fear or taboo surrounding exposure of the upper body is, in my opinion, unfounded, cultural standards about the body and modesty vary widely and evolve over time. Traditional societies in many parts of the world, including parts of India, treated the human body more pragmatically. In my childhood, I remember village life where women would go to rivers or ghats, for washing clothes at rivers, They would often cover themselves with thin veils or towels, which were sometimes semi-transparent, but it wasn‚Äôt seen as a big deal. Women breastfed in public comfortably, and there was no stigma attached to it. Modesty and body exposure were balanced with practicality and cultural norms, often without the same notions of \"indecency\" applied in today's standards.\n\nIn fact, many older women didn‚Äôt wear blouses because that‚Äôs a practice introduced by the British (I don't like to blame Westerners, I mean look at France but Foreign influences Islam, African and European played a bif role) The impact of colonial influence on clothing and modesty in India is well-documented.; for example, introduced blouses and petticoats to the sari, shifting away from traditional drapes that had different styles depending on climate, region, and occasion, traditional clothing didn‚Äôt typically include them, let alone bras. Of course, women were mindful of their surroundings, so it wasn‚Äôt just nudity everywhere, but the relaxed approach was common, and most people didn‚Äôt object. Sometimes, older men or adults would respectfully look away or step aside to provide privacy and comfortable space, that's how we were taught and grew up.\n\nHistorically, depictions of the body were also uncontroversial. If you look at ancient temples and statues, bare bodies‚Äîincluding breasts‚Äîare everywhere, celebrated as natural, sculptures and statues depict nudity in ways that reflect divine and human forms, aiming to celebrate life rather than stigmatize certain body parts.  \n  \nI truly believe we should revive that balanced approach to the human body found in Indian and other Asian cultures along with modesty, like we still see in temples today where fat-pandits might wear just a dhoti or lungi, with upper bodies uncovered with their breast on the loose /s. Jokes apart, The way the human form is understood and respected in one‚Äôs surroundings has profound impacts on personal comfort, body image, and societal values and it would be interesting to see some shifts in todays world where we need the normalcy, let nature heal, that and re-engage with these earlier, more holistic perspectives.",

You are a realist and are talking about how a certain way or clothing increases the chances of women being exposed to danger. \n\nAnd you are absolutely correct. \n\nBut do you think it'll stop once 100% of women wear 'socially acceptable ' clothes?  Nope. The justification behind their shit actions just change is all. \n\nWhen you think about it that way, I think it's better to live life like they want to instead of cower in fear. Since they're just as exposed to the danger either ways. \n\nAnd this act of going against the norm helps establish a new normal (One where torn jeans are accepted as a fashion style for example).  Women have been taking risks to better their living conditions and expand the range of freedom them possess from centuries. And we are here now because of those risks. \n\nI think we should be supportive of it. But again, i acknowledge how dangerous is it. And I agree that it increases their chance of exposure to danger. But it is necessary. \n\nI love wearing shorts to the beach for example and it's extremely normal for me to do so. It's so comfortable to be that way. But the female experience is vastly different. And that's what brings this necessity. \n\nAlso, the example of the dark alley is kinda skewed towards the belief that exposure of skin by women is what leads to them being threatened. But that's not the case as evidenced by even kids getting raped. So yeah. Someone with ill intentions isn't stopped by the amount of clothes on a person's body.

        "post": "See. You are making a point that sounds very logical but it isn't really. There's alot of problem with what you said at multiple levels. \n\n1. You are making an act a natural part of being a male/female of the society. By stating that men staring can be 'natural' and 'appreciative' you are normalising the objectifying behaviour. Women are not things to appreciate. I know how it seems natural to do so. But it is in reality rooted in how we treated women so far that has resulted in this. The notion dismisses the uncomfortable and invasive aspects of such attention and makes it alot harder for women to feel safer. Definitely not suggesting that men who 'admire' according to you are all doing so with I'll intentions; I'm just suggesting that we be more receptive of women's problems around this problem and keep ourselves in check for the possibility of making them uncomfortable. \n\nAnd GOD. Please don't rationalise or justify staring. It's bullshit to stare to appreciate. It's never right. You do that to objects brother. People don't want random dudes on the sidewalk to appreciate them. Ever wondered why women are more comfortable with random women appreciating their outfits but not random men? Surprise surprise. It's because of the collective shit experiences women had in India wrt men. It's not as simple as you make it out to be. \n\nControl the desire to admire and keep your eyes to yourself if it comes to that since it'll not make them feel unsafe at the very least. \n\n2. You're talking about an extreme yourself here. Suggesting that only people who have gone through trauma are afraid of being stared at. Absolutely f**ing not. Everyone is. Even men to a degree but especially women. They're in India man. No one feels safe about being looked at for more than a second. And please don't be insensitive to people's experiences. Trauma isn't so trivial. Be more mindful please. You don't have to accomodate people with trauma but don't make assumptions about it atleast. \n\n3. Your message from the perspective of a man who has experienced nothing of the horrors of being a female member of the society is so skewed because of the privilege we have of being men. I appreciate you being ready to take action against anyone mistreating women. But it's not always so direct. Making a comfortable space for women where they feel safe is so much more than being there when there's an extreme event happening. \n\nThe idea that women should ‚Äúenjoy the attention‚Äù is dismissive of the discomfort or objectification they may experience. \n\nThe fact that you're wondering why women would feel uncomfortable (as inferred from '\"why do you feel insecure? Please enjoy the attention as long as it's safe flirting..... \") explains so much about what you understand of their experience and how you view the whole issue. \n\nI suggest you read a bit more on their experience in the shitty society we live in. There's so many books and articles on this.\n\nPlease understand that my purpose in typing this out is not to chide you but to make sure more people are understanding of the world we live in and do their best to cultivate a safe space. \n\nI hope this isn't taken as an offense and you reflect on your ideas so far. \n\nAnd to anyone supportive of the original comment this reply was about. Please feel free to get back to me either through this comment section or via dm (provided that you think I'm wrong in my thinking). I would really love to learn more and contribute towards the discourse.",

You can try for one bedroom flats in dondaparthy area or akkayapalem or railway new colony. \n\nAnd you can find good local food in dwaraka nagar\nNamely Sairam parlor, nethi vindu, and all kinds of non veg food also can be found in these surrounding areas. People in Visakhapatnam are very friendly happy to help, if you can't speak Telugu, they will definitely find a way and put an effort to help you. And if you don't know telugu, i would recommend you to learn basic telugu, this is help you and make your life easier because we visakhapatnam people are not good at Hindi. and the best part is that you have rk beach 3-4 km from sankaramatam, I will recommend you have atleast a bicycle, you can go hang out in rk beach, in weekend you can try to go to the kailasagiri ( a park on the kailash hill 6km from sankaramatam) you can take a ropeway and get to see the beautiful views of the coast alongside the urban side of the city. You can msg me if u need any kind of help.",

Being stranded at RJY railway station or bus stand isn‚Äôt going to be comfortable at that time of the night. \n\n\nAPSRTC will have buses every one hour passing by the airport which will go to RJY.

Talking about economic aspects, chennai has long been a major commercial port even before independence and irrespective of the government in power there is always a pro business agenda so for investments it is a stable political atmosphere and a conducive economic environment. From where did you get that chess grandmasters are doing good because they were taught history?\n\nMoreover the history currently being taught just outlines the kingdoms before British (which does include the southern states), during British and post british it doesn‚Äôt venture so deep.

I was shocked, my mom suffered for nothing for those many days due to this idiot, so we went through the process of removal and her face got swelling towards tooth side, it was very bad. The doc in suraksha said file a case but my mom being mom decided not to go for a fight. \nAbout suraksha dental, the doc is lady, they took amazing care, even me 23M went for a checkup as I got tartar buildup, scaling is done perfectly, (300 for consultation, 1500/- for scaling, rest will addup if process is increased, new tooth cap 8k,).. so I highly recommend this dental. \nAnyway do research ur own and this follow up comments.",

U can personally come to my home and witness my mom speaking fluent pain all those months... Bro I don't hate doctors, I'm just saying the truth, he knows he did a mistake, he's covering his stuff, let my mom suffer, I wasnt that big to make any decisions, I'm just a guy watching things go on,.... I respect doctors bro, ENT specialist Dr Appa Rao solved my tinnitus( Dwaraka nagar 2nd lane), Dr Chitti pantulu physician( same 2nd lane building )I visit him for my childhood for any problems along with my family members too, Dr sridar babu for thyroid( jagadamba)., Homeopathy doc behind Gvmc building lot of good doctors... Dr Ramana murty in Health City for bone issues. I lived here my entire life in Vizag. Though I not connected to MBBS cuz I'm a engg., I watch The good doctor, Dr House series. All those good shows... Trust me bro I know enough stuff to cancel that dudes licence for whatever he did to my mom's. To respect my mom's choice I can't put up the file or name. I'm going end this here whatever reply follows up. Hope u choose some good mentors in ur career doc. Good luck. peace.",

A solid guidebook works great too.\n3. A decent camera or smartphone to snap bird photos for future reference.\n\nFor those of us who like a bit more organization :\n\n1. Notebook and pen (or a notes app) to jot down bird species, locations, behaviors‚Äîanything you want to remember.\n2. A checklist of birds you hope to spot.\n3. A small bird feeder (and some feed) to attract birds when needed.\n\nAnd above all, remember to be patient and keep your EQ high, so you can enjoy the birds without disturbing them.\n\nGood luck and happy birding! üôÇ",

Act guy is sending a seperate email to me to pay 450/- but as I have been an act customer since 2013 in hyd and took earliest connections when it came to vizag.  They reduced it to 390/- this year.\nUsually Netflix 4k plan is 649/-( act gives 199/- Netflix mobile or  720p plan ( which I didn't find it worthy and clear on a 15 inch laptop +450/- extra for plan upgrade) \nNow if you can talk and convince them and tell them that you gonna leave act and go to other operator am sure they gonna work some way around and give you a good offer. \nAs far as viewing experience is concerned 199/- plan wasn't that great for me.  So upgraded. \n\nSorry for the lengthy message but I hope I answered your question",

So maybe the times you saw ATC probably determined it was best to land/take off in that one direction . \n\nI believe the runway was unidirectional at one point but as the airport got busier and runway was expanded (they also got a 2nd runway ) it was  made bidirectional. It is highly unlikely they will ditch  a bidirectional and revert back to a unidirectional one - as far as I know it won‚Äôt be enough for VTZ‚Äôs civilian air traffic . Yes please check , am also curious to know üôÇ",

I guess the Visakhapatnam sensor should be on top of Kailasagiri Hill (although I must find out next time I go).\n\n\nOthers who want quick alerts can directly use their app - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lightening.live.damini\n\nAnother system of NSRC-LDS (National Remote Sensing Center - Lightning Detection Sensors) of ISRO uses a mix of Boltek short and long-range sensors to find 10KMx10KM grids lightning. These are currently around 50% fewer sensors across India than IITM-LLN ones.\nhttps://bhuvan-app1.nrsc.gov.in/lightning/\n\nBoth use the popular Time of Arrival algorithm to triangulate the lightning location from 4 sensors for reliable estimation, although three is enough.\nIt's a simple high school physics thing, as light travels at a fixed speed, and if we have all lightning sensors synced accurately with GPS, we can estimate the difference of distances travelled by light with time of arrival. Solving three such sensor differences gets us unique intersection points of lightning.\n\nI believe the system is HITL for triggering these alerts when such lightning observed crosses a certain threshold per minute, owing to the delay of such alerts.",

Life is going fine in vizag without IT companies and will go better without them. Govt can sit lazy and  can show these companies buildings as development fr the next 5 years. While in real time they do nothing to bring these companies to cities but just arrange the programs to announce we brought these many companies, provided jobs to these many . And be collecting the huge taxes from companies n employees  . Eventually build the metro n make this a stupid traffic polluted city just like any other metro politan city and destroy the nature and beauty of vizag with over crowded roads, buildings and population, smoky everywhere. Which is happening in Bengaluru currently. Check out the recent news and also Kolkata's n Mumbai harsh and rude traffics . Just wash out your eyes and look out what's happening to the cities that is lacking good nature trees and fresh air to breathe . We don't need f*king big packaged companies to vizag but just peace and homely city .",

From my experience interviewing candidates from these countries especially Brazil : If they can speak good English or have good communication skills it is very tough to compete with their Tech aptitude and work ethic and stand out in interviews. They are extremely hard working too. Going forward : I hope it won‚Äôt be challenging for Tech folks in India to find remote jobs in the US.",

And the process is similar whether you‚Äôre in a metro or a Tier 1/2 city.\n\nFolks usually don‚Äôt just band up together to go on trips or hang out without knowing someone first, or when any third party that they trust is organising something.\n\nI think a good start could be finding ways to meet new people: maybe try EcoHikes or any other such groups that organize trips near Vizag. There‚Äôs quite a few! And from there, you can figure out who your vibe matches with. Then you‚Äôll have your peeps to hang out and party with.\n\nAnother option could be to find interest groups for any hobbies you might have. There‚Äôs a board Games cafe, and they used to organize Meet Ups as well. Or if you enjoy cycling/bike rides, there‚Äôs groups dedicated to that too.\n\nHappy to help if you‚Äôre looking for cycling buddies since I am part of the WhatsApp group",

Like...just imagine if there is a person in neck deep problems..one who doesn't believe in god...gets broken down in such conditions and commit suicides etc...but PPL with strong god believe system somehow puts all the burden on God and maybe they'll survive the bad phase.

        "post": "Where though?\n\nThe value of land around Visakhapatnam Steel Plant , aka  Kurmanepalem , shot up because of Steel plant employees.\n\nThere is already an existing investment worth thousands of crores sunk into that land, not to mention the infrastructure built to connect to the larger value chain.\n\nCertain economic zones define the city and provide the basis of economic activity around that region. Take it away, we will be left with a shell of a town. We need an alternative plan to compensate for this loss before we decide to move. Mere real estate won't cut it.\n\nVisakhapatnam at the very heart, is an industrial city, like Detroit. It has a lot of polluting zones spread throughout its perimeter. We either slowly need to transition into services, or higher end manufacturing to sustain the real estate in the city.",

They are one of the best government managed bus fleet and are usually punctual. \n\nLastly, avoid travelling through bus where possible.

There is nothing to \"respect\" in someone who can't even go for an evening just because of a few dogs.\n\n2. The only time spent outside one's apartment is inside another box, aka car. This is not only bad for the environment, but also for health.\n\n3. If an unprovoked dog attacks you, just shoo the dog away.\n\nPS: Go out, live a life and let nothing bother you.

Better plan for Duronto as the train reaches on time (unless there's an issue).\n\nThere is a train early morning from Vizag to Araku with Vista dome coaches. You can enjoy the train journey with hills and valleys. \n\nYou can plan Araku for 2 days with a night stay.. explore the hill station, view points, Borra Caves, Chaprai and kothapally waterfalls, coffee and tribal museums..\n\nPlan a day or two in Vizag covering places like Simhachalam, Kanaka Maha Lakshmi Temple, RK beach, Submarine and Aircraft museums, Kailasagiri, Thotlakonda.\n\nOne day for Arasavalli, Srikurmam.\n\nThese are most covered places by tourists. Plan as per your convenience.\n\nHave a safe holiday!!!",

Especially in my native place \"Yellamanchili\", There were mandaps, near the village lake. My father who was a History teacher used to narrate these to us during our childhood.

Everyone, 2-3 generations back, came on the pretext on employment or business or education, and settled here. Everyone is every corner of the city. Nobody belongs here but they say they are from here. On Sankranthis or others festivals, everybody leaves the City. \n\nTrue Vizag people are the ones who trace their families origin to One Town Area / Poorna market / Relli veedhi / all the old parts beyond Jagadamba. And the fact is, they dont brag that they are from Vizag, they are more humble or subtle of their origins.",

Please don't expect a college life similar to happy days,it will be quite opposite. \n\nInfrastructure wise ANITS is ok, faculty is good they help you whenever you need. Placements are also decent ,all my friends are now in very good positions (self learning and a lot of practice of course). College timings are a great advantage if you want to learn anything out of the box, 8.40 to 3.20 and only 5 days a week. You will get plenty of time to study and learn new skills.\n\nBy the way i am a 2014-18 mechanical grad. Don't ask about core jobs they are very limited and 70% of our batch are into software.",

        "post": "Uhmmm... It's definitely a good comprehensive list but I'm not so sure about them being the best. Could be a difference of opinion.\n\nItalian - Upland Bistro kicks ass out of FSM; even Brew n Bistro makes some Italian dishes better  \nBakery - Food ex can be added for baked items (breads & cakes), may be bake my wish   \nKamath Restaurant is a must to include in Biryani & North Indian  \nDosa/Tiffin in general - Sai Ram better than the rest with Venkatadri & Nethi Vindu giving decent competition. House of dosas suck.   \nCafe - though not a cafe, McD coffee (McCafe) is the best after bean board. Even comparable. But may be you excluded it cuz it's present everywhere (North India doesn't have McCafe tho)  \nAndhra - you missed Nellore Mess - probably the best tasting thali in the city (better than subbiah imo, but subbiah has a better spread and presentation), Kalyani Mess @ MVP  \nStreet food - way off the mark here. LIC street food is some of the worst I've tasted. But Park hotel one is decent. There's one in MVP colony too. Noodles/Chinese @ YMCA Bismillah truck, Momos @ Aqua, Muri mixture @ beach or MVP AS Raja Circle, Noodles @ Bismillah at behind collector office, Chat @ Chandu sweets  \nSweets @ Sivarama (not sure if they're still operating :( ) near choultry jn.   \nPizza @ La Pino'z (avg but budget friendly), Upland Bistro, Brew n Bistro, Gypsy (I haven't tried but heard), Ciro's Pizza  \nBuffet - Fairfield Marriott (not too expensive but really nice spread), Radisson (expensive but great taste), BBQ Nation & ABs (but these are common food chains)",

Large untapped market of hydroponics for fresh herbs and exotics. Focus on diversity and both b2b and b2c\n4. Premium varieties of mushrooms, you can also go towards mycelium products later like clothing or compostable packaging.\n5. Training centre with assignment-oriented curriculum and better industry tie-ups. reach out to Startup valley and AP Medtech Zone for their needs\n5. Local flower bouquet door delivery. You can bulk buy flowers on city outskirts, and focus on creative designs and custom choices. \n6. Proper city event tracker (public and private) and organiser. News mostly reports it after the event and most insta channels are dead. Yovizag does too much at a time haphazardly.  What the city needs is like a fillum, as u see in Delhi, but your market lies in matching teams with venues and organisers, and while offering simple payment gateway for tickets.\n7. The burger company franchise (ig u have tried them in Delhi?) Could be a 20% growth rate YOY if managed well\n8. Well-maintained coworking space with hourly-daily slots for desks. You can attach a cafe to it with Araku coffee, maybe. Design towards encouraging natural interactions for better ideas among people like proper round table, separate presentation room, soundproof cabins for single persons, \n9. Custom fun events place with hourly rates and a proper app to match with players and chat for scheduling. Think of populating with board games, puzzles, and chess;... Again, it could attach a cafe within. Could even push towards local tournaments.\n10. Elderly care. Matching their daily needs with regular timelines. Not just checking up on their health, but also being able to finish simple errands like their grocery shopping. \n11. Pet care and grooming center where people can drop their pets.\n\nAll the best, and welcome to city.",

The traffic is very less compared to going towards RJY or Vijayawada side. \n\nIf you start early, and avoid city traffic (which should be there till Thagarapuvalasa) - you ll be able to reach in 3-4 hours from Vizag RK beach area. In fact 4 hours is on the higher side. \n\nBut there are not many good food places on the way, just some dhaba style or tea shops. In contrast, we have good food stops & even cafe coffee day stores, on the way to Rajahmundry. \n\nEnjoy your drive & beautiful national highway.",

Although this shop is closed since many years for now I still to this day miss that place and their samosas.\n\nIf anyone knows this place and have had their samosas then upvote this post and if you guys have any idea if this shop has moved to any new location then please share the details",

All kids have same level of access to the curriculum. \n- Don't make it a scam. \n\nThis should be a good start, there's high demand for more experiential schools over traditional one's. \n\nKnow that parents have also realised that having some fancy affiliation to syllabus from abroad isn't for them (oxford, harvard, etc certification). \n\nLook into American International School/ Theosophical Society School in Chennai or The Doon School for a good idea. \n\nThis is a dream wishlist but with the right resources - very doable. \n\nHappy to talk more over DM.",

        "post": "1 (a). Glad you brought up the self-learning thing. I realised the greatest I as a teacher can do with a kid is to make her a self-learner.\n\nAs an experiment, I ran a learning centre based on self-learning and peer learning for an year in my hometown. I was very satisfied with the results. Now I have to see how well I can train my teachers to implement in whatever capacity they can.\n\n1 (b). Understanding will be at the core. My classes go like a Socratic dialogue. It's a back and forth conversation between me and kids. We derive stuff and arrive at conclusions. I'm unsure how much of it can be implemented because I'm uncertain if w ecan find teachers who are as knowledgeable to let the kids question them in anyway and give a satisfactory answer. We don't plan on charging a bomb from the students like the other schools do. The fees will be around 60k as we are planning. We can't get someone who's real good in subject. But rest assured the pay will be much better than what the other schools are paying. I am preparing frame work to put understanding at the core independent of the teachers. Let's see how it works out.\n\n2. Yes. We'll focus on competencies and ask the parents to focus on child's progress in the same. Than compare with others (as long as they are doing progress and are not far behind the others)\n\n3. We'll have a very very special library and to turn them into readers will be a core thing. Usually the parents don't pay much attention to this. They are hyper focused on STEM. But as a teacher I noticed the inability of the kids to read and comprehend is heavily hampering their ability to understand the textbooks. It was big roadblock for self-learning when I was experimenting last year.\n\n4. Answered in one of the comments above.\n\n5. As of yet, I haven't focused much on the social and emotional learning. As per me, it's a higher order thing. First few years of the school will be about building a strong academic program and gradually bring in the higher order things. Untill the STEM subjects are really good, parents won't let us do anything other than that. I gotta factor in that as well. As for connect with nature. We have a tie up with a local conservation NGO. He's real good at his job.\n\n6. In plans to include basic life skills. We intend to make the kids learn all the basic chores of a household. Civc sense, financial literacy and personal well-being will also be covered at some point of their schooling. This again is a higher order thing. I'll have to wait until the academics are set and parents are happy. Once we achieve that, parents will dance to our tunes. Also, people generally do one workshop on each of these topics and that's the end of it. I'd rather not do a workshop than do a namesake one. I genuinely intend to see the kids implementing them in their life.\n\n7. We are planning on tie-up with pediatrics for this.\n\n8. Yeah, I'm fortunate enough to be engaging with educators and science institutions across the country. They will get exposed to lot of stuff.",

No need of any BEd degree or teaching experience.\n\nNo extra hours - I believe the syllabus till tenth grade is too less. It's designed with the slowest learner in mind. If my teacher is failing to educate a kid with in such relaxed time frame, it's a problem with teaching. Teaching extra hours is not the solution (that'd be just blaming the kids) improving the teaching is the way to go about. Extra hours eating up the play time is the worst thing that can happen to childhood.\n\nSports thing has been answered in other comments\n\nExperimenting and playing around will be there too but a lot of understanding can come from good teaching of theory itself. Experiments are just supplementary IMO.\n\nDiscipline and Rewards - The definition of discipline keeps changing over time. But them having an understanding the necessity of rules will help them behave better I feel. Kids these days get a lot of ‚ùÑÔ∏è parenting. Rewards for good behaviour is a bit of controversial thing. It might make them do good for the rewards. They should be doing good because it's good. PERIOD. It comes down to building morality and ethical behaviour, these are higher order things.

Those proverbs are timeless and leave a deep mark on an attentive and curious child. \n\nI am glad you have high ideals for your future school and I am sure you will do your best. I wish I could be of help in someway because opening a small school has always been my aim. I strongly believe in moulding the  kids minds when they are young in growing up to be a good human. \n\nI agree that empathy etc are higher order , but I still believe depending on the age of kids these lessons can still be given to them in the form of moral stories and then asking them to give their interpretation of them. \n\nI understand the pressure from parents to make their children STEM capable right from young age , especially in a place like vizag. \n\nI always believed quantity dissolves quality, so if the school has too many teachers or too many kids I feel the vision might not be shared by all of the faculty and that will lead to dilution of quality. \n\nIt makes me really happy that you brought civic sense up. Maybe basic traffic rules should also be added. \n\nI am really impressed by the ideas you have for the school , wish your venture all the best! I am sure you will do your best.",

Don't need a high protein diet, taking around 70-80g protein for your weight is more than enough. As you increase weight, keep increasing the surplus but not more than 500 calories otherwise you will just gain fat. Also, beginners will gain more muscle so have good amount of carbs and fats. Don't listen to unqualified trainers and bro science on the internet. If you eat like a pig to gain weight you will simply get fat, no matter what you cannot gain more than around 1 kg of muscle in a month with training, dont be fooled by the weight scale and strength in gym because beginners are just improving their nerve connections in the muscle and strength is because of that. If you just eat too much and gain weight it will be difficult to lose the fat later on and diet will get stricter so just 500 calories surplus will do it. Be consistent and in 6 months you will see good results but be aware its a lifestyle change and not something you start and end.",

Yes you might find Ola a lot on the roads because Ola is slightly less priced compared to ather.

Once there was an issue with the charger and I took it to the service center it was resolved in 15 mins, so software update was needed. Close your eyes and go for ather if you want a reliable product, go for Ola if you want something budget friendly and it has longer range.",

I started working when I was 17 1/2 and started my trading journey plus entered the Indian Startup ecosystem for the very first time. A year later I made huge profits because of Covid crypto pump and had an amazing trading history. I am lucky that I was born with a silver spoon and had great connections within family friends who were all UHNIs. So just built a fund on the network and asked everyone to put in a few crores for amazing returns. They got more than they expected and started recommending me to their other network which helps me achieve a big AUM. In 2022 I started giving guest lectures in colleges on how fundraising work ans what is the thing VCs look upto. Since that I‚Äôve been investing in startups across all sectors and all equity markets too. \nI hope this info helps",

        "post": "I have very vivid memories of that day. It was Sunday early morning on September 14th 1997. I was awake looking forward to a great Sunday and was about to go to the beach (we lived on the beach road). We were all suddenly rocked by a loud explosion and the windows in our house shook. This was in Kirlampudi Layout which was quite far and we had no idea what it could be. The tremors felt like a small magnitude earthquake. We rushed upstairs to our apartment terrace and soon saw dark smoke looming in the sky.\n\nMy Dad worked at HPCL and he soon suspected a mishap at either HPCL or Coramandel fertilizers. Within an hour back then we had access to Siti Cable which dropped a flash news of a blast at HPCL and soon everyone understood that this is such a disaster that struck the city. As everyone here mentioned people in closer proximity to that area were asked to evacuate and our friends at HPCL were soon going to take shelter at many of their colleagues houses. It being on a Sunday was actually such a miracle, in hindsight we averted a mini Chernobyl situation. INH Kalyani hospital was the only hospital closest and the situation there was horrendous.\n\nThe reason for the explosion was deemed to be LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) leak from one of the LPG tank farms. People driving around can still notice the spherical tanks (would be very different from the traditional tanks where you store petrol and other products). LPG unlike the commercial gas we get at our house, doesn't have that pungent smell that we can instantly detect. Infact that odor is specifically added for us to detect a gas leak at homes. So when the leak happened at the LPG tank farms no one knew about the leak and apparently the gas leak was so bad that it clouded the entire area of HPCL in haze. The gas cloud started looming until a point where it found a source of ignition and then BOOM. All the buildings were brought to the ground in seconds with a huge blast.\n\nThere were also nearby petroleum product tanks that caught on fire and firefighters took almost 3-7 if my memory serves right to control the fire. Remember you can't use water to douse petroleum fire. So Navy and central government sent special flights of foam (used for dousing petroleum fires) to control the fire. I believe that night there was a special navy flight that landed in Vizag. Back then Vizag airport would curtail operation after late afternoon as the Navy has more control over it. Acid rain as everyone said followed on that night with extreme thunderstorms. For a couple of months my Dad was out of work as his whole administration building was in rubble. \n\nIt took a few years for the rebuilding effort to complete. When I look back to that day, I feel grateful for it being a Sunday. At the same time I'm very sorry for those unfortunate people who were on shift duty and lost their lives.",

In vizag there is no requirement for majority of steel plant employees to move out of the vicinity of steel plant. Same goes for most people as they are either government employees or some form of self employment which does not require them to commute. With present circumstances if any company were to conduct a survey to check commercial viability of vizag metro it will surely not be a good business decision. Vizag is highly clustered and there are no economic hubs like gachibowli or financial district. The pharma SEZ and Achutapuram SEZ which are the only distant economic hubs which have people travelling are no where close to the proposed metro line.\n\nTLDR: It's a redundant project which consumes resources and suffocates the existing roads while being utterly useless to most population.",

Keeping this in mind things are planned. \n\nOne thing is developing infrastructure to attract investments and people and other is developing after attracting investments. \n\nVisakhapatnam and Vijayawada-Amaravati are the cities where the investments are deemed to come.

It can also affect how well your dishwasher or other cleaning tools work because detergent interacts with hard water, so you must use more detergent.\n5. if you use a coffee pot, it affects your coffee taste.\n6. Also affects your fish aquarium health\n\nNow, on the trueness part, you can easily carry water hardness test strips to the home you check out and verify yourself.\n\nNow, on the solution part, if you think you must face it, there are water softeners, although it would easily cost 50k to 1L for upfront investment.\n\nThanks to my high school chemistry teacher.",

The water is not soft in the Pendurthi area too but it's 10x better than what we get in Madhurawada. These are the problems I faced since moving to Madhurawada regarding hard water:\n1) Entire family started having hair problems & severe hairfall. \n2) we shifted 20+ plants and creepers but only 2-3 are growing now.\n3) More frequent changes of filters in the water purifier.\n4) All taps & showers are always covered with white residue no matter how many times we clean it.\n5) Even there is a white residue formation on vehicles if we do not wipe the water immediately after water washing at home.\nAll of these are the problems we have faced despite our community having a WATER SOFTENER.",

But the clutch did give a hassle in traffic and when inquired about it, the sales guy said Turbos are not so friendly with half clutch ( my current vehicle is i10 MT 2008) in 1st gear ( especially in inclines & bumper -bumper traffic).So, we have to use the accelerator a bit more than usual to move the car from a stalled position.",

I was surprised many people just blatantly ignore traffic signals (ie to stop on red light) and also some signals are quite confusing in some areas sometime it works sometimes it doesn't.

(i.e. government etc)\n\nIf you see his interviews, you will get a background that his above books are much more than novels.\n\nAlso Isaac Asimov's books on science fiction, apart from being very interesting, can really help broaden our minds.\n\nI am a light reader.

If you are aiming for GATE, you can start preparing from 2nd year when you have core subjects and your clg library  may also allow you to borrow books. For now , concentrate on coding.",

Descend back to vizag via thadipudi reservior to Vizianagaram and then to vizag via Bheemili Beach. Cover the lovely and underrated beaches along the coast.

        "post": "Hello Welcome to Visakhapatnam. You can go for a sea facing room near rk beach ( some options for you : Ambika sea green , gateway hotel, bay view hotel, palm beach, the park, Radisson blu), you can get good cab connectivity through uber, ola etc. and you can plan \n\nDay 1 : you can plan an early visit to the 1200year old, Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy devalayam it is a 15-18km ride and you will come across the hills of vizag on the way. Around 4.30pm go the kailasagiri park via the ropeway, and the views are amazing, spend some time there get on the short rail tour on the kailasagiri hill to view the majestic views of vizags hills and the coastline.in the evening go to the submarine and the aircraft musuem and have the local muri mixture and bajjis ü§©üòãüòã. You will love it trust me. And have a good seafacing dinner. And forgot to add, you should try the sea in Raju gari dhaba to try the proper local sea food and nonveg delicacies. \n\nDay 2 you can head to the araku valley, trust me get on the vizag kirandul express and trust me the experience will be remembered all your life.. you get to experience the lush green eastern ghats on the way to the araku valley hill station, have the bongulo chicken, it is a delicacy in araku wherein the chicken in made in a bamboo shoot, the taste is worth the try. At araku you can go to the burra caves which are the largest cave structures in the country and millions of years old. Worth the visit and you can head to the ranajileda waterfalls, the tribal museum, try the locally grown coffee, araku coffee is criminally underrated and glad that it is gaining it's popularity these days. \nYou can return back to vizag the same day through the same kirandul express @22.30.pm pls check the availability and the running status of the train time to time. It is a ghat railway so at times the train gets cancelled.\n\nDay 3 : I would suggest you to rent a vehicle and go for a drive on the road to bhimili from the harbour area, it is a drive worth your visit from delhi. I would suggest you go go around 2pm, it might sound a little weird but the waters are literally blue as a topaz... And in the evening try to go into the city and try shopping at jagadamba center area, poorna market it is the heart of city of vizag.\n\nDay 4 : if you want to go for a sea bath, you should head to the rushikonda beach the waters are not harsh and deep, and a caution note, do not take a bath in the rk beach area the waves are quite dangerous and risky. \n\nYou can msg me if you need any kind of assistance in the city and people here can manage Hindi a bit üòÅ and the people here are one of the nicest...",

Everyone knows either Hindi or English.\n\nUber was very very easily available as compared to Delhi, max 2 min waiting. \n\nVery good weather. \n\nI found food to be very spicy for my taste but very tasty. Tried Sri Sairam parlour, flying monster, and nethi Vindu \n\nHotel : liked gateway, some issue of seepage but, Novotel will be a better option. Bay view is not good. Hotels are not as fancy as Delhi, gateway I think is a Taj property but nowhere compared to Delhi Taj\n\nVisited kailasgiri, all the museums, simhichalam temple, sagar nagar beach, Rushikonda, rk, lighthouse and market \n\n\nPrice wise Ubers were cheap only like base fare starting with 100",

Side lo apandi - stop by the side, for telling auto wale bhaiya to stop the auto by the side since my destination has arrived.\n3. Perugu - for the Telugu helpers in my hostel mess, since they don't put the curl bowl in your plate unless reminded.\n\nBut then again we mostly stay in our hostel and travel with our friends so our only conversation with locals is when doing transactions and everyone knows English numbers these days, and our Telugu batchmates know English so there isn't a problem in communication.

Not to go directly towards any one philosopher. \nInstead i would suggest you read a book ' Sophie's world' i had suggested this book to many people who want to get into philosophy. It is such an interesting book that even children can understand it it was made for children. Plus it would make you understand the whole base of western philosophy from its evolution till now,While the story is going in the background. I would 100x suggest this book. And then you can go onto something like a book  \"story of philosophy\" by will durant. Then You can understand many things as you have a bigger picture in your mind (the rationalist and the idealist and so on)\nPlus another thing reading philosophy is not like reading fiction or self help. Sometimes things don't strike instantly it takes time rereading helps a lot. So don't worry. I would also say follow some yt channels which are excellent \n\nPursuit of wonders\nSchool of life\nPhilosophy tube\nDesi philosopher",

(During 2006-7 I think)\n\nAs a politician he has his flaws, but as a person he is multiple levels above than many politicians in the current era. \n\nBtw I don't have any political affiliations and this is purely upon personal experiences (having pursued my education at vzm and stayed in that town for 5 years on job purpose).",

Cosmic will definitely have people but there are chances they will not treat you well if you go as a stag or go alone. \n\nthere are some bars at bheemli side but there is police checking often in the night so that could be a bummer. anyways will not advice you to drink and drive. if you are planning to get drunk properly come via ola/rapido bike, go back via ola/uber auto. \n\n*these recos are based on my experience and in the areas i have roamed around. if you are from a diff part of the city, then there would be other places. \n\nalso, Happy Birthday in advance ü™∑‚úåüèΩüå∑",

By entirely eliminating a language spoken by majority of the population you will just be limiting the said person to fewer locations. Moreover, most national institutions with which you have to interact irrespective of where you are in india like banks, government offices, steel plants, defence and other places have personnel moving, it is not practical for them to learn local language for their brief period of posting but the locals might have a constant influx of hindi speaking personnel.

However, being Indian citizens, it will definitely help if we learn Hindi since most of the people in this nation speak it. I am not saying that we need to impose Hindi on our children, but it will benefit us all if we at least study it so that we might easily survive anywhere. We can't wait for people speaking Hindi to learn our languages, but if we learn Hindi, that will help us all.

Because Hyderabad is a big city, you'll have more exposure to different people and may get good opportunities. Just my perspective onto choosing the university. Given that both are State government institutions, I wouldn't expect much in their infrastructure. Choosing OU would be a logical approach taking consideration about future opportunities and growth. I wouldn't say Vizag doesn't have opportunities but as we already know hyd has more infrastructure and many organizations that are already established, so from a career perspective I would suggest OU.\nBut looking at your ranks, I feel you will have a better shot in IISCs and IITs. They would cater your talent in a better way. Congratulations on your achievement! I hope you'll have a great career ahead.",
